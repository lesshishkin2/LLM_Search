## Shareholders,

it is with great satisfaction that we present to you, on behalf of the entire Board of Directors, whom we thank for their commitment, the fifth Integrated Report of the Poste Italiane Group.

2022 was a challenging year, spent in the full throws of recovery from the Covid-19 health crisis and in the knowledge that we are operating, now and in the near future, in an increasingly changing and unpredictable environment. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and the resulting humanitarian and energy supply crisis, has strained the resilience of our economy and community. This dramatic event, significantly altering the geopolitical balance at global level, which marked the first months of last year and whose effects, however, persist, draws attention to the need for companies to orient their business strategies towards a path of transition to a more sustainable economy, which places the central focus on the needs of the communities and territories in which they operate. Moreover, the continuation of the pandemic for the third consecutive year, although presenting an opportunity for change and accelerating crucial processes for the country's development such as the digital transition, risks, however, aggravating, in a broader context, inequalities by eroding social cohesion and increasing the social gap. In fact, this risk, according to the World Economic Forum's 2023 Global Risk Report, ranks seventh globally among the most burdensome risks of the next ten years, along with climate change, biodiversity loss, large-scale involuntary migration and the depletion of available natural resources.

In order to face the many challenges arising from the current context, we are convinced of the effectiveness of our sustainable business model in the medium to long term, with a solid strategy based on measurable objectives that take into account the demands of all stakeholders, part of the commitment to maintaining ongoing dialogue. Aspects of innovation and sustainability have been at the core of all Group strategies since 2020, but in 2022 they were further strengthened and integrated into the challenging goals contained in the Strategic Plan. Thanks to numerous initiatives and projects in line with an integrated vision, we can say that the Group is solid and sustainable, capable of providing the most innovative answers to seize the best opportunities even in a highly challenging and changing environment.

Poste Italiane aims to support the sustainable development of the country and to be a guide for responsible growth and digital evolution through the definition and achievement of financial, operational and sustainability objectives - understood in its broadest sense. With regard to environmental sustainability, in recent years we 

{11}------------------------------------------------

have seen a growing importance of these issues both at a global level, with the great resonance of COP 26 and the historic success of the establishment of the Loss & Damage fund during COP 27, and at a European level, with the publications on Environmental Taxonomy. At the national level, on the other hand, the substantial allocations in the PNRR (National Recovery and Resilience Plan) for the country's green transition confirm the need to implement processes increasingly focused on circular economy, sustainable mobility, energy efficiency of buildings and pollution monitoring, in order to improve the sustainability of the economic system to achieve a zero environmental impact society. In this regard, in order to meet the demands of institutions and our stakeholders, we have continued to pursue numerous activities to combat climate change. The ambitious commitments made by Poste Italiane are aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, well ahead of the time-line set by the European Union, and at the same time reflect the innovative green philosophy adopted by the Group that pervades all our services, processes and products. The holistic approach is also reflected in a greater involvement of customers through a carbon offsetting programme, the "Green Challenge", which rewards their "green behaviour", i.e. all those virtuous aspects of behaviour that benefit the environment.

From a social point of view, in 2022 Poste Italiane once again demonstrated that it is close to people and territories by making a significant contribution to the country. In fact, the Group, continuing with the approach adopted in 2021, made its channels available to the public for booking requests for the fourth dose of the Covid vaccine, giving them the opportunity to book in different ways. Moreover, Poste Italiane's commitment to accompanying the country's recovery is further demonstrated by the Polis Project, a social inclusion programme aimed at countering the depopulation of small towns and contributing to their socio-economic development by fostering interaction with the local areas and synergies with local institutions.

Poste Italiane has once again been able to monitor the changes in an increasingly demanding market, identifying the challenges of the future by adopting a longterm perspective to achieve competitive advantage. A demonstration of this is the Group's recent entry into the energy market, which confirms the Company as a reference point for satisfying the needs of Italian families, no longer only related to savings, investment, financing, fixed and mobile telephony and fibre, but also linked to electricity and gas. The evolution of our activities and our growth path have always been geared towards customers, who can count on the widespread presence of our organisation, which boasts a physical network of around 13,000 Post Offices, as well as an extensive digital infrastructure capable of serving the entire national population. And it is precisely in order to anticipate the economic and social needs of citizens, especially at a delicate time such as that dictated by the current energy crisis, that Poste Italiane invests in its all-round expertise, with a special focus on the development and continuous improvement of its range of products and services.

{12}------------------------------------------------

The Poste Italiane Group plays a central role in the country's economy. With a turnover of around €11.9 billion and the highest number of employees among Italian companies, it is confirmed in 2022 as the leading employer and the largest company in the logistics sector in Italy, with a leading position also in the financial, insurance and payment services sectors. The Group's recent entry into the energy sector further strengthens our presence in the region and our ability to meet citizens' needs even during a crisis.

Goals such as these are certainly the result of the effectiveness of the path taken towards the creation of shared value, with a view to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as defined by the United Nations. The business model adopted by Poste Italiane is constantly evolving and adapting to the needs dictated by the economic and social context and the demands of the Company's stakeholders, while maintaining its values and principles.

In particular, Poste Italiane's Sustainability Strategy consists of the Strategic Plan, which contains sustainability targets and objectives aligned to the highest national, European and global targets, and of a body of corporate regulations including all the Sustainability Policies that regulate the non-financial aspects of the Group, its principles and corporate values.

Although in 2022 we were able to experience an effective return to the habits that had been lost due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the desire to establish an increasingly resilient business approach was reinforced. The integration of social, environmental and governance factors into our business model - which enabled us to overcome a period of sudden destabilisation - has been and will continue to be the key to a broader risk assessment, enabling the Group to think long-term.

Given the historical context in which we operate, and as the leading Company in the logistics sector in Italy, the relationship with our stakeholders is increasingly central, and fostering dialogue with them allows us to maintain a solid relationship of trust, based on shared values such as transparency and inclusion, which are at the heart of our growth path towards a sustainable future. In this regard, this year's Multi-stakeholder Forum once again was a crucial opportunity to discuss and listen to stakeholders, in full agreement with the key objectives of the Group's Sustainability Strategy, based on eight pillars: Integrity and transparency, People development, Diversity and inclusion, Creating value for the country, Green transition, Customer experience, Innovation and Sustainable finance. The event, now in its sixth year, was live streamed and was attended by more than 1,000 people, together with whom we assessed the significance of the sustainability impacts related to our business and defined the material issues for Poste Italiane, in line with the regulatory developments of the GRI and CSRD standards.

The multiple recognitions obtained, nationally and internationally, from the most prestigious rating agencies confirm the effectiveness and far-sightedness of the sustainable strategies undertaken by the Group in recent years. In continuity with 2021, in 2022, Poste Italiane confirmed its 

{13}------------------------------------------------

presence in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, a prestigious sustainability index which incorporates the best companies in the world in terms of the sustainable management of their business, and within the more selective Europe segment. In addition, the Group was not only reconfirmed as a leader in the fight against climate change by CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), being placing for the third consecutive year in the "Leadership" bracket of the international rankings with an A- rating, but was also ranked by Sustainalytics as a top ESG performer from a panel of more than 15,000 companies assessed globally, achieving an ESG Risk Rating of 12.7 (Low Risk). These prestigious awards are followed by further confirmations in equally important indices, such as Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), FTSE4GOOD, MIB ESG and Euronext Vigeo-Eiris World 120. With regard to the latter, we are proud to report that the Company was again ranked first among out of 5,000 companies evaluated on the basis of sustainability performance. In addition to being included again this year in the 2023 edition of S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook, ranked in the Top 5% S&P Global ESG Score 2022, the Group also earned the "AA" rating from MSCI, for the significant progress it has made with regard to the social sphere, improving its corporate sustainability performance and leadership in the sector.

The results achieved in 2022, pursued with great determination thanks to our people, not only give us special satisfaction with the path taken, but also strengthen our reputation as they highlight Poste Italiane's concrete commitment to creating shared value. We are also aware that it is only possible to meet the new challenges of sustainable development through constant listening and dialogue with regard to the needs of our stakeholders and the pursuit of common goals.

## Presentation of the Integrated Report

Il The Poste Italiane Group's Integrated Report is now in its fifth edition and aims to illustrate how sustainability is increasingly integrated into the business model and corporate strategies, providing a clear and comprehensive representation of the Company's financial, environmental, social and governance performance.

The Integrated Report allows Poste Italiane to effectively represent the interrelationship between the financial and sustainability elements that contribute to the definition of the Group's business model and strategy, such as the external context, strategy, business model and forms of financial and non-financial capital. The document is a useful tool for stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding of the processes the Group has put in place to support the country's growth and create shared value, describing what has been achieved while offering an overview of short-, medium- and long-term ambitions and goals.

The social and environmental impacts generated by the Group place the process of integrating sustainability into the business model at the centre of the value creation process for the Company and all its stakeholders, with the aim of contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The path taken by the Group is underpinned by certain strategic and investment choices in the main forms of capital, such as financial, human, physical-structural, intellectual, social-relational and natural, i.e. assets which contribute to sustainable success of the Company, but which on the other hand are impacted by the activities of the Company itself. For this reason, in continuity with previous years, the document includes an overview of the correlation between the Company's performance and the types of capital listed above, and for each of them the results achieved are illustrated in Chapter 2 "Highlights".

Poste Italiane, through numerous ESG projects, aims to lead the country's sustainability path, build an inclusive society and offer a greener future. Through this document, the Group aims to represent its green strategy, aimed at continuing its path of entry into the energy market, accelerating the energy transition process of the business. In addition to proposing sustainable products and offers, entering the energy market gives Poste Italiane a further boost in engaging customers and guiding them towards environmentally aware behaviour.

In continuity with the preparation of the previous Integrated Report and consistent with regulatory requirements, the 2022 Integrated Report contains

Integrated Report

the section dedicated to the European Environmental Taxonomy, found within Chapter 9 "Consolidated Non-Financial Statements". To this end, the Group undertook a careful analysis of its activities and the regulatory framework issued by European institutions and developed a specific methodological approach aimed at providing adequate disclosure. In line with EU Regulation no. 852/2020 (Taxonomy Regulation), Poste Italiane's Integrated Report include a differentiated disclosure of regulated KPIs, based on its industrial operations (Non Financial Undertakings) and financial operations (Financial Undertakings): in relation to industrial operations, the Group carried out an assessment in order to identify its share of Turnover, Capex and Opex aligned to the Taxonomy, while in relation to financial operations it has provided - for the second year of reporting - a disclosure of KPIs in accordance with the Eligibility analyses, in line with the Regulation.

In addition, Chapter 5 describes the methodology adopted by the Group for materiality analysis, revised to comply with the provisions of the 2021 update of the GRI standards for the inside-out perspective, and taking into account the EFRAG recommendations, albeit still in draft, for the outside-in perspective. The adoption of the dual materiality process to identify Poste Italiane's material issues allows the Group to anticipate the entry into force of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, scheduled for FY 2024. In this regard, the main change from previous years is the updated system of indicators used for ESG performance reporting, in line with the new GRI Universal Standard 2021.

In continuity with previous years, the 2022 Integrated Report contain the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, which is integrated into the Report on Operations in the Chapter 9 thereof. The NFS was drawn up in accordance with the requirements of Articles 3 and 4 of Legislative Decree no. 254/2016 and the "Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards" defined by the GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter "GRI Standards") according to "in accordance" option. Chapter 9 of the section "Reporting standards and criteria" includes a connecting table that indicates the information content required by the Decree and its positioning within the Integrated Report, with the aim of making it easier to find all non-financial information. In addition, such content is also noted, to make it easily identifiable, by this infographic:

#### NFS

The Group's fifth Integrated Report was prepared by applying the Integrated Reporting framework published by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). In addition, Poste Italiane also provided disclosure of the impacts of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, which ESMA1 required issuers to report in their 2022 Annual Financial Reports and Non-Financial Statements. In addition to the impacts of the conflict, ESMA also identifies climate change issues as a priority in the non-financial report for 2022. Confirming Poste Italiane's commitment to combating climate change, it should be noted that as

of 2021 the Group has officially joined the supporters of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure. In order to broaden the Group's disclosure on the management of risks and opportunities related to climate change, this document illustrates how the Group's activities are managed according to the recommendations of the TCFD, and also provides a table linking the TCFD recommendations with the contents of the Integrated Report. Finally, with the aim of reflecting potential future developments regarding climate change, Poste Italiane once again this year carried out a review of climate scenarios using as a reference the documents drawn up by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the main literature on the subject.

In line with previous years, the indicators used for the preparation of the 2022 Integrated Report were reclassified according to SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) standards, with the aim of contributing to the development of a shared and universal framework for non-financial reporting. In this sense, the indicators relating to "material ESG metrics" found in the latest version, from September 2020, of the document "Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation" presented to the World Economic Forum in January of the same year, have been reported again this year. By continuously updating its non-financial reporting methodology, the Poste Italiane Group demonstrates its commitment to the demands of the financial market, which is increasingly focused on assessing companies according to environmental, social and governance criteria.

The document also contains a table linking the objectives pursued by the Group, the GRI Standards indicators and the SDGs, which represents a useful tool to illustrate how the Company contributes to the achievement of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and their 169 targets, also incorporating the latest guidelines of the most up-to-date version of the "SDG Compass" document drawn up by GRI, UN Global Compact and WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development).

In addition to the Integrated Report, the Annual Financial Report is composed of the following documents: the consolidated financial statements of the Poste Italiane Group, Poste Italiane's separate financial statements, including BancoPosta RFC's Separate Report, and the related attestations pursuant to art. 154 *bis* paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree no. 58/1998 and the reports of the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Independent Auditors, referring to the financial year ended 31 December 2022, and the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure published on the Company's website, in the Governance section, which is to be considered an integral part and to which reference should be made for further details on the Corporate Governance structure.

{18}------------------------------------------------

This Annual Financial Report, which was approved by the Board of Directors of Poste Italiane SpA on 29 March 2023, will be made available to the public within the terms provided for by the regulations in force (i.e., by 30 April 2023) on the following web page: https: https://www.posteitaliane.it/it/bilanci-e-relazioni.html#/.

#### 2.1 Outcomes of the Value Creation Process at Poste Italiane NFS

During 2022, the path of shared value creation undertaken by the Poste Italiane Group generated excellent results at system level, through the significant investments in the six forms of capital which underpin the Company: financial, human, physical-structural, intellectual, social-relational and natural, and in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals framework.

{21}------------------------------------------------

Through its leadership in the logistics, financial, insurance and payment services sectors, Poste Italiane plays a key role in the creation of economic value both for the stakeholders directly impacted by its business activities and for the country as a whole.

In particular, the activities carried out by Poste Italiane generate impacts on GDP, employment income, employment and contributions to PA. Impacts can be distinguished into:

- z Direct impacts: impacts generated by the operating activities carried out directly by Poste Italiane;
- z Indirect impacts: impacts generated along the supply chain as a result of Poste Italiane's spending on goods and services (€3.2 billion in 2022) from Italian suppliers;
- z Induced impacts: impacts generated by consumer spending that is realised through the income earned by workers employed directly and indirectly by the Group.

tax revenue during 2022

In 2022, the Poste Italiane Group generated impacts on the country in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) totalling €12.9 billion and, in employing roughly €181 thousand people, contributed around €2.1 billion to the income of the Public Administration in terms of tax revenue. Furthermore, it is possible to estimate that Poste Italiane contributed directly and indirectly to the distribution of income to workers, totalling €7 billion.

The daily work and commitment of the Group's individual people contributes to the creation of value by Poste Italiane. In this regard, over the course of 2022, each person at Poste Italiane contributed to the creation of economic impacts for the region amounting to €107 thousand of GDP, €58 thousand of income for families, €11.6 thousand of tax contributions and the employment of 1.5 people.

Below are two focus areas of Poste Italiane's suppliers, respectively the impacts generated by Italian suppliers in the individual Territorial Areas and the indirect contributions generated by Italian SME suppliers.

## Impacts generated in individual Territorial Areas in 2022

Considering the region of the registered office of suppliers, the indirect impacts generated by them in each Territorial Area in 2022 have been identified.

With reference to the various areas examined, there are values of Gross Domestic Product between €70 million and €1 billion. This results in an employment level of no less than one 1,500 people and total employment income between €45 million and €490 million approximately.

{25}------------------------------------------------

## Impacts of Italian SME suppliers

Considering the parameters defined by the European Commission, the Italian suppliers that are characterised as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the indirect impacts attributable to them have been identified.

In 2022, SMEs impacted on the level of Gross Domestic Product for a value of €1.1 billion, leading to the employment of 17,000 people and an income distribution of around €527 million. Finally, more than €340 million has been generated in terms of tax revenue.

## The economic value generated and distributed by the Poste Italiane Group

Poste Italiane also provides an overview of the economic value generated and distributed by the Company to its stakeholders such as suppliers, employees, lenders, the community, the public administration and shareholders. This value represents the wealth produced by the Company and its impact on key stakeholder categories, in accordance with the requirements of GRI Standards 201-1 reporting standard.

In 2022, more than 84% of the wealth produced by the Company was distributed to its stakeholders. In particular, employees and suppliers are among the stakeholder categories that benefit most from the wealth produced by the Company, accounting respectively for 51.65% and 29.91% of the total value distributed.

The economic value created in 2022 amounts to over €11.9 billion, roughly 84% distributed to stakeholders

## 3. Outlook

Since the beginning of the year 2022, global economic activity has shown progressive signs of slowing down, related initially to the spread of Covid-19 variants and, subsequently, to the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in February. The unstable geopolitical situation continued throughout the year, accompanied by the energy crisis, largely a consequence of the conflict, and pressures on supply chains; these factors led to an escalation of energy prices, which affected those of other goods and services. This was compounded during the period by the repeated interest rate hikes decided by the major central banks to mitigate rising inflation. This context has led to growing uncertainty about the economic outlook, with inevitable risks of a deterioration in the macroeconomic scenario for 2023.

Against this backdrop, the Poste Italiane Group achieved record financial results in 2022, in line with the upgraded guidance communicated to the "financial community" in November 2022, which allowed for an increase in the dividend paid to shareholders for the year 2022 (DPS at €0.650, +10% y/y compared to the +7% y/y forecast by the dividend policy). The Poste Italiane Group, in addition to distinguishing itself through a diversified business structure that allows it to benefit from a constant natural balancing effect between the trends affecting its businesses, has historically demonstrated resilience in times of economic uncertainty and financial turbulence, indeed establishing itself as a "safe harbour" for savers, thanks to a portfolio of financial offerings characterised by products with reduced risk exposure and volatility. In this regard, it should be noted that the Group has negligible exposures to credit institutions recently involved in financial distress. The Group's cost structure is flexible, with a significant component of variable costs correlated to revenue; the Group mainly sources and competes in the domestic market, has no production units located in the countries affected by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, or neighbouring countries, and has minor commercial relations with these countries; therefore, it has no direct repercussions that could have a significant impact on its business or on its profitability. Lastly, the Group benefits from the effects of actions implemented during favourable market periods, aimed at mitigating price fluctuations of production inputs or hedging transactions against the risk of fluctuations in fuel prices and gas and energy supplies. The National Collective Labour Agreement is valid until the end of 2023.

On 30 March 2023, the strategy update for the current year was presented to the financial community, reviewing the outlook of the various Strategic Business Units. The objective of configuring Poste Italiane as a platform company evolving towards a diversified and integrated business model to offer Italians a single, omnichannel access point for an increasingly wide range of products/services was confirmed.

In the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit: after a 2022 of substantial stability in the parcels and logistics segment, a return to a growth path is expected, however conditioned by the uncertainty of the macroeconomic reference variables. In this scenario, the Group aims to accelerate the transformation path towards an "all-round logistics operator": the acquisition of Plurima, aimed at entering the specific hospital logistics sector, the renewal of the partnership with Amazon for 5 years, and the recent partnership with DHL (announced on 10 March 2023), which confirms the Group's commitment to developing its international business, are part of this strategy. The SBU, in the mail segment, will continue to adjust its offer and tariffs, managing the structural mail decline related to e-substitution.

In the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit, postal savings will remain at the centre of the Group's financial services offering, with a renewed and competitive commercial proposition, confirming itself as a simple and transparent tool for savers; at the same time, the net interest income will continue to contribute to revenue supported by higher rates in a changed macro environment.

The Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit confirms its relevance for the group's profitability also following the implementation of the IFRS17 accounting standard, with the recognition of a Contractual Service Margin (CSM) in transition of approximately €11 billion that will support sustainable profitability over time. The Group builds on its leading position in the life business and aims to develop the P&C business with an integrated modular offering of customised protection, assistance and service solutions. The acquisition of Net Insurance, which will be finalised during the second quarter, will help accelerate the growth and profitability of the protection business.

With regard to the Payments and Mobile Strategic Business Unit, the acquisition of LIS, a leader in proximity payments, will ensure an acceleration of the Group's omnichannel strategy, with the development of new services and leveraging the complementary nature of the tobacconist network with post offices and digital channels. In addition, the new Poste Energia offer for electricity and gas was launched on the market in January 2023, now available on digital web and app channels, with over 150 thousand contracts signed by the end of March. The offer exemplifies the clarity of the business proposition and ease of use of Poste Italiane's services, ensuring a unique omnichannel customer experience.

{35}------------------------------------------------

Continuing its commitment to the Group's digital transformation by supporting citizens, businesses and the PA in the digitalisation process, Poste Italiane confirms its role as a strategic pillar by effectively and efficiently connecting the country. The recent acquisition of Sourcesense, a company operating in the development of cloud-native solutions based on open source technology, aims to accelerate the Group's digital transformation with the internalisation of core competencies supporting a cutting-edge operating platform, while through the acquisition of Agile Lab, the Group will strengthen its presence in the modern "data industry", enhancing its capabilities to build "data-driven" businesses for internal use and for the market.

As part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, the Group will invest significant resources in the implementation of "Polis", a strategic project to support the country's social cohesion with particular reference to approximately 7,000 municipalities with a population of less than 15 thousand inhabitants by becoming the home of the public administration's digital services. Some 250 co-working spaces nationwide are also planned, as well as the implementation of numerous initiatives to support the country's energy transition.

In the path of transition towards carbon neutrality by 2030, investments and strategic initiatives will continue, such as the renewal of the delivery fleet with low-emission vehicles, the installation of photovoltaic panels for energy supply, the modernisation of the fleet with low CO2 emission vehicles, and enhancement of building efficiency; the replacement of current Postepay cards with cards made of eco-sustainable materials and with digital cards will also continue, as well as the development of specific offers aimed at enhancing customers' sustainable behaviour.

The year 2022 marked a decisive point in the country's recovery after more than two years of the Covid-19 health crisis, during which Poste Italiane was able to further confirm its centrality in supporting the community and the territory in which it operates. Thanks to its widespread presence throughout the country, the Group was a point of reference for the country at a time of defining new post-pandemic balances, as well as humanitarian and energy crises due to the conflict in Ukraine. Poste Italiane has strengthened its collaboration with institutions, supporting the public administration on the one hand and small municipalities on the other, contributing to the country's digital and sustainable transition.

#### 4.4.1 Omnichannel Strategy NFS

The digital transformation undertaken by Poste Italiane in recent years has involved not only its own offer, but also the distribution model which, through an omnichannel strategy, allows the Company the possibility to provide services in step with the changed needs of its customers.

Digital channels, and more generally remote channels, support the physical channel, Poste Italiane's historical asset, every day in the management of customer relations. In 2022, Poste Italiane's omnichannel interaction platform reached more than 20 million interactions per day.

daily interactions as part of omnichannel >20 mln

The pandemic encouraged the acceleration of the transition to the new operating model, enabling the Company to respond quickly to changes in the market by leveraging its digital platforms, that exploit the opportunities arising from technological innovation to create new personalised products and services and by opening up additional channels of communication with its customers.

The Group's integrated multi-channel platform provides for the monitoring of customers and the provision of services through 3 channels:

- z the proprietary physical network: this consists of the Post Offices, the sales force for business customers and the logistics network for mail and parcel delivery;
- z a digital infrastructure and remote contact points: made up of all the Group's *[digital properties](#page-483-0)* and the contact centre, capable of serving the entire national population;
- z the third-party physical network: consisting of approximately 58 thousand points, the result of commercial partnership agreements for the marketing of Group products and services man[aged als](#page-51-0)o through the recent acquisition of the company LIS. For further details, please refer to the section 'Group structure'.

{61}------------------------------------------------

Below is a representation of the Group's omnichannel platform:

## 4.4.1.1 Physical network of Post Offices

The post office network is governed by the Post office network business function organised into Macro Areas, Branches and Post Offices covering the whole country.

12,755 Post Offices

| Total                           | 12,893 | 54.0             | 12,899 | 52.7             |

All workforce data is shown in full-time equivalent terms in thousands.

The performance of the workforce reflects the management dynamics during the period. In particular, within the Post Offices, the change reflects new hires and internal promotions from other areas/functions offset, only partially, by terminations of employment during the year. The increase in staff in the Macro Areas is mainly attributable to the organisational change that saw the transfer of the POE segment from the Business and Public Administration function to the Post office network function, as described above in the section "Ownership and Organisational Structure".

In order to better support the evolution of the front end, to support the enrichment and dynamism of the offer, the process of enhancing skills through the establishment of the Front End Operator8 continues in order to better manage innovative businesses (Third-Party Motor Liability, Fibre and Energy) and an innovative offer format will be implemented on a panel of about 1,250 post offices. At 31 December 2022, more than 1,000 Post Offices have been completed with a new layout aimed at improving the customer experience and comfort (of which 460 POs with Corners, 575 POs with Lowered Counter Posts and 2 POs with New Corner Layout).

In order to increase commercial effectiveness towards digital customers who do not go to Post Offices, a "pilot" project is under way in three Territorial Branches with the introduction of the Remote Consultant Specialist, who sends customers dedicated savings and investment proposals and contacts them to inform them of the possibility of subscribing to the proposals received digitally (reserved area of the website using advanced electronic signature).

In order to implement the full integration of the commercial channel dedicated to Small Economic Operators within the Post office network commercial channel, the organisational model of the function was developed with the aim of ensuring unitary governance of the commercial chain, maximising synergies between the business and retail networks.

The network of Reception Operators was strengthened in about 220 post offices with the aim of supporting the counter operations and improving the customer experience, and the number of Multi-ethnic Post Offices9 was extended to 35 in order to take into account the unique area characteristics and the needs of areas with a higher density of foreign citizens.

The initiative is consistent with Poste Italiane's broader strategy of sustainable, digital and inclusive development.

The Polis Project generates significant impacts throughout the territory, also with a view to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

On 30 January 2023, in the presence of the President of the Republic, the President of the Council, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, numerous government representatives, and institutions, the Polis Project was presented in Rome by the Chairwoman and CEO of the Company, to the 7,000 mayors of the municipalities involved, which in Italy represent 90% of the municipalities with a land area equal to 80% of the country and in which 16 million people live.

## 4.4.1.2 Physical network - Business and Public Administration

The commercial supervision and sale of the Group's products and services to businesses and Central and Local Public Administration is guaranteed by Poste Italiane's Business and Public Administration function.

The organisation of the sales force guarantees territorial coverage focused by product sector, through:

- z 3 Sales Macro Areas (Lombardy North West, Central North and North East, Central South), with exclusive commercial responsibility for mail and communication revenue;
- z 2 Sales areas dedicated to the commercial management of products/services of logistics and parcels and specialised by industry;
- z 1 Commercial area specialising in the offer of financial and insurance products for large business customers and Public Administration;
- z 1 Commercial area for Central and Local Public Administration related to Metropolitan Regions and Cities.

## 4.4.1.3 Logistics network

The Group's mail and parcel services are provided through two integrated and synergistic logistics networks: the postal logistics network for the management of mail, now evolved to also allow the management of small parcels and the parcel logistics network able to handle all types of parcel.

The integration between the two networks was strengthened already in 2020 by increasing the interchange of small parcel volumes between the two networks (carriable parcels, i.e. under 5 kilos) using cost-effectiveness as distinguishing factor. The delivery of these products in Italy can be carried out indistinctly by the postal and parcel logistics network according to a dynamic approach, aimed at maximising efficiency for each area.

{67}------------------------------------------------

#### Postal logistics network activities

The postal logistics network accepts, sorts and delivers mail products and small parcels (carriable parcels). The following chart provides an overview of the postal logistics network value chain and the main quantitative drivers.

The organisational model for the postal logistics network consists of 6 centrally coordinated Logistics Macro Areas, which handle all stages of the value chain: acceptance and collection, outbound sorting, transport, inbound sorting and delivery. At the same time, this model makes it possible to have a single management system for the entire territory and to be able to adapt it to each specific situation with targeted interventions.

{68}------------------------------------------------

The model's Macro Areas are shown below.

The development of the workforce for the year 2022, shown in the table below, reflects a trend in line with or down from the previous year in all organisational areas.

## 4.4.1.4 Digital infrastructure and remote contact points - web, app and contact centre

To support the Group's digital transformation, a technology engine based on hybrid *[cloud](#page-482-0)* , *[open](#page-485-0) API* and exponential technologies10 has been implemented and applied to all the Group's activities and infrastructures. The Group has implemented a programme of "digital transformation" of all its service and offer models in order to guarantee its customers full digital contact experiences. This programme has accelerated significantly since 2021, in view of the effects of the current health emergency, in order to make the Group's products fully accessible to customers in completely safe conditions.

The Group's Digital Properties are as follows:

poste.it website: poste.it is the Group's consumer and business portal, where the range of services offered to customers is available. The portal also allows customers to consult and manage the products in their possession.

Postepay app: app for purchasing and managing Postepay payment cards, telco products and the Energy offer; payments can also be made via the app on the move.

BancoPosta app: app to purchase and manage the Group's financial/insurance offer on the move: accounts, postal savings and insurance policies.

Post Office app: app that allows you to locate the Post Office and book an appointment, reducing waiting time. Via the app it is possible to check the status of a shipment, book a pick-up at the Post Office or send parcels or mail.

PosteID app: Poste Italiane's Digital Identity app (SPID - *Sistema Pubblico d'Identità Digitale*).

During the period, the Group worked to strengthen the digital sales channel, expanding the range of products and services that can be purchased directly through the digital properties.

{71}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane's digital web and app channels are the access point to on-line services for 36.8 million retail users (33.8 million at 31 December 2021) and position themselves as both direct sales and after-sales channels. 68% of Poste Italiane's interactions and 36% of its transactions are handled every day via remote channels (around 20% via digital channels). The average daily web and app users for 2022 was 5.8 million (4.3 million average daily users in 2021). Digital channel transactions also grew, and in 2022 amounted to 152.6 million for a transaction value of €40.3 billion (124.7 million transactions in 2021 for a transaction value of €32.7 billion).

>36%

of daily operations in 2022 took place on the new channels

For more details on the performance [of digit](#page-229-0)al channels in the period, please refer to the section "Digital and third-party networks in the Group's omnichannel strategy".

## 4.4.1.5 Third-party physical network

Third-party networks play a crucial role in the Group's omnichannel strategy. They have been strengthened to provide Poste Italiane customers with a valid alternative to the post offices for access to transactional services. The objective is to create a platform for the integration of the Group's products with new third-party distribution channels and to use third-party services within the Group's commercial offerings, also introducing innovative services with high added value. Poste Italiane contracted an extensive network of contact points, which was further strengthened during the year with the acquisition of LIS, and counts 58 thousand contact points at 31 December 2022.

#### Third-party networks

* Organized Distribution & Large Organized Retailers.

The acquisition of LIS in September 2022 increased the operations of the omnichannel platform, increasing average daily customer interactions by about 0.6 million.

In particular, operations increased significantly in the third-party network channel, which was supplemented by the new products handled following the acquisition (telephone top-ups of other operators, pagoPA and other services), reaching about one million average daily transactions (+161% compared to 2021), of which LIS accounts for about 88%.

{72}------------------------------------------------

The omnichannel importance of proximity networks is confirmed by the significant growth of parcel management (acceptance and delivery) on the third-party networks, which with 17.2 million parcels handled in 2022 shows 173% growth over 2021.

During the year 2022, the PuntoPoste11 network expanded with the entry of more than 1,600 new points. At 31 December 2022, the Punto Poste network had more than 15,000 contact points.

## Macroeconomic environment

During 2022, the world economy was affected by the repercussions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the new lockdown measures taken in China until November, in response to the new wave of Covid-19. The outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict put pressure on global supply chains and commodity markets, fuelling inflationary dynamics on a global scale.

In the major advanced economies, the slowdown in economic activity in 2022 is attributable to weakening demand and the start of a cycle of tightening of restrictive monetary policies adopted by major central banks to counter rising inflationary pressures.

The easing of pandemic-related restrictions and supply-side bottlenecks, starting in spring, boosted activity until the third quarter, but in recent months uncertainty among economic actors has increased and cyclical indicators point to a worsening of the cyclical phase.

The International Monetary Fund estimates12 that world output will decelerate to 2.9% in 2023 (from 3.4% in 2022). The slowdown will be more pronounced in the euro area, for which the Fund estimates growth of 0.7% in 2023. The European Commission's estimate in November is just 0.3%.

The dynamics of the global economy, already characterised by slowing, if not contracting, areas, will depend heavily in the coming months on an effective calibration of monetary policy, the evolution of the conflict and the emergence of possible new supply bottlenecks, linked to new pandemic waves in China.

Inflation continued to remain at high levels during the year; in November 2022, inflation in the euro area reached 10% and the ECB believes it will remain above the 2% target for a prolonged period of time. At its December 2022 meeting, the Governing Council raised the three key interest rates13 by 50 basis points for the fourth consecutive time, permanently abandoning the accommodative monetary policy stance maintained during the pandemic period.

Italian GDP growth in 2022 +3.7%

In July 2022, the ECB announced the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), an instrument that will support an effective transmission of monetary policy in all euro area countries, again to fulfil the primary objective of ensuring price stability.

After the deep recession of 2020, the Italian economy recorded a vigorous recovery, with seven consecutive quarters of higher-than-expected growth, which in the third quarter of 2022 brought GDP 0.5 percentage points above the level of the previous quarter and 2.6% above the level of the third quarter of 2021, thanks to the increase in consumption of services and durable goods and the still very favourable trend in investments in capital goods14. Gross domestic product decreased by 0.1% in Q4 2022 compared to the previous quarter and grew by 1.4% compared to Q4 202115, consolidating growth for 2022 that remains sustained at 3.7% for the whole year.

<sup>11.</sup> The Punto Poste network consists of Pick-up Points - businesses offering parcel pick-up and delivery services - and Lockers, self-service points with extended opening hours. The network includes around 14,000 tobacconists licensed to provide mail and parcel services.

{73}------------------------------------------------

The unemployment rate dropped by more than one percentage point during the year and remained stable in the last quarter of 2022 at 7.8%16.

In October and November 2022, harmonised inflation peaked at 12.6% from 9.4% in September to 12.3% y/y in December, with an annual average of 8.7%.

In the Update Note to the DEF17, approved by the Council of Ministers in December, the government revised upwards the path of the household consumption deflator18 and that of GDP. Growth has also been revised upwards for 2022, with the trend level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increasing to 3.7% from the 3.3% projected by the DEF in September. By contrast, the forecast for 2023 drops substantially, from 2.4% to 0.4%.

Tax and social security receipts in the first eight months of 2022 were higher than expected, despite impressive energy cost mitigation measures. As a result of the change introduced in the accounting treatment of tax credits by ISTAT, the general government net debt for 202219 in relation to GDP, at 8.0% of GDP, increased compared to the government's forecast (5.1% of GDP). According to the new projections20 the high nominal growth of the economy expected this year and the improvement in the primary balance will lead to a descent of the gross debt-to-GDP ratio more pronounced than in the DEF, going from 149.8% in 2021 to 144.7% in 2022 (147% in the DEF).

The postal services market is going through a period of radical change, primarily linked to the digital transformation, which has influenced the volume of letters and parcels in circulation. At the macro-trend level, the continuing structural decline in traditional mail volumes, replaced by digital forms of communication (e-mail, instant messaging, etc.), is accompanied by an increase in the volume of parcels sent.

In particular, for the letter mail market, after the substantial drop in 2020 volumes (-19% compared to 2019) , 2021 confirmed a trend of substantial stability (+0.2% compared to 2020)21. In 2022, the market decreased further (-5.3% compared to 2021)21, mainly as a consequence of e-substitution effects.

The parcel sector experienced a period of uncertainty in 2022, but this did not affect the value of the market, which grew strongly in the pandemic years. The effects conditioning the continuation of the growth trend recorded in recent years can be summarised as the generalised increase in costs brought about by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the rise in inflation with the consequent decrease in consumer purchasing power, and the lower propensity for private purchases (including on-line). This trend is also visible on a global level, as witnessed by the results of several leading companies.

For the Italian parcel sector, estimates for 202222 therefore point to a stable market value compared to 2021.

### Regulatory context and evolution of the regulatory scenario

Expense of the Universal Postal Service

On 30 December 2019, Poste Italiane and the Ministry of Economic Development signed the new Contratto di Programma (Service Contract) for the years 2020-2024; it is effective from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2024.

On 1 December 2020, the European Commission approved the compensation for public service obligations provided for in the 2020-2024 Service Contract in the amount of €262 million per year. The compensation system for the public service obligations undertaken by the Company was deemed to be fully compliant with the applicable EU rules on State aid.

On 1 July 2021, AGCom Resolution 199/21/CONS was published, concluding the procedure to verify the net cost of the universal postal service incurred by Poste Italiane for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. In particular, the burden of the universal postal service for these years has been quantified at €354.5, €334.5 and €175 million respectively. For the 2019 financial year, although the quantified charge (€175 million) is lower than the authorised offsets (€262 million), the charge for the provision of the universal postal service over the entire period (i.e., the previous 2016-2019 Service Contract) is in any case higher than the offsets authorised by the European Commission. The Authority also established that the universal service charge for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 is inequitable and that, for the same years, in continuity with what was established in previous years, the Compensation Fund referred to in article 10 of Legislative Decree no. 261/1999 is not established. Poste Italiane appealed the aforementioned measure on 22 September 2021 before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court (TAR).

The Regional Administrative Court, in ruling no. 11416/2022 published on 5 September 2022, partially upheld the appeal on the verification of the responsibility for the years 2011-2012 by acknowledging the non-activation of the compensation fund for the year 2011. Poste Italiane and AGCom appealed the Regional Administrative Court ruling to the Council of State and the hearing on the merits has been set for 18 May 2023.

With AGCom Resolution 28/23/CONS, published on 24 February 2023, the Authority initiated the verification procedure for calculating the net cost of the universal postal service for the years 2020 and 2021.

Publisher tariff subsidies

Law Decree no. 162 of 30 December 2019 - as converted by Law no. 8 of 28 February 2020 - ordered that reimbursements of publisher tariff subsidies to Poste Italiane continue "for a duration equal to that of the universal postal service" (i.e. until April 2026). The application of the regulation is subject to approval by the European Commission.

In August 2020, the procedure was initiated for pre-notification of the Service of General Economic Interest (SGEI) to the Commission for the period 2020-2026.

The 2022 Budget Law (Law no. 234 of 30 December 2021) left unchanged the appropriations for the years 2022 and 2023, amounting to €52.5 million, and provided for the same amount for 2024.

The 2023 Budget Law (Law no. 197 of 30 December 2022) stipulated that the reimbursement of publishing postal subsidies would be made through the resources of the Fund for Pluralism and Innovation in Information. To this end, the Fund was supplemented with the amount of €75.9 million for the year 2023 and €55 million as of 2024, instead of the amounts provided for in the previous Budget Law

Replicability of offers (EU2 areas)

With Resolution 27/22/CONS of 4 February 2022 "Revision of the criteria for defining EU2 areas and identification of the relevant ZIP codes", AGCom concluded the procedure for the revision of the criteria for defining "EU2 Areas"23 with the identification of the EU2 ZIP codes for both unrecorded mail and recorded mail. The new perimeter defined by the Authority will be used, in particular, for the purposes of identifying the territorial coverage of the wholesale offers for access to its network referred to in the AGCM proceeding C12333, (measure no. 28497 of 22 December 2020 with which certain behavioural measures were prescribed for Poste Italiane as a result of the approval of the merger between Poste Italiane SpA and Nexive Group Srl), as well as for the purposes of the replicability test of Poste Italiane's multiple mailing offers, governed by AGCom Resolution 452/18/CONS.

On 19 September 2022, AGCom initiated, with Resolution 309/22/CONS, the preliminary proceedings relating to the revision of the replicability test, i.e. the test that Poste Italiane is required to carry out before submitting all mail offers (submitted in public and private tenders) worth more than €500,000 and to notify the Authority within the next 30 days, demonstrating that the Company's offer is "replicable" by a hypothetical efficient competitor.

The time limit for the proceedings is set at 180 days from the date of publication of the resolution. Poste Italiane sent its contribution.

Mailboxes

In accordance with article 2, paragraph 7, of the 2020-2024 Service Contract, on 24 June 2020, Poste Italiane submitted to AGCom a proposal to adjust the number of mailboxes to the changed size of the market and customer needs, taking into account the trend in postal volumes and actual use by users.

Following the conclusion of the public consultation and, also following the comments sent by Poste Italiane, Resolution no. 308/22/CONS was published on 27 September 2022, which redefined the criteria for the distribution of mailboxes, adopting, in particular, that of the distance from the nearest box by percentage of the resident population. In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Resolution, on 29 November 2022, Poste Italiane sent the relevant Implementation Plan to the Authority, which, once the implementation period (24 months) has been completed, will, when fully implemented, enable the targets set out in the Resolution to be achieved. Further discussions are under way with the Authority, to which Poste Italiane must send an update on the progressive implementation of the Plan.

Digital notification of PA documents New platform

nota fuori tabella: 23

Law Decree no. 76 of 16 July 2020 (Simplifications Decree), converted into Law no. 120 of 11 September 2020, by means of Article 26, as amended, regulates the implementation of the platform for the digital notification of Public Administration documents. The operator of the platform will be the company PagoPA, which may entrust its implementation, in whole or in part, to Poste Italiane as Universal Service Provider.

The technical and operational modalities for the operation of the platform were defined by Decree no. 58 of 8 February 2022 of the Ministry for Technological Innovation and Digital Transition, published in Official Journal no. 130 of 6 June 2022.

The costs, criteria and modalities for the distribution and reimbursement of the costs for the service of documents via the platform referred to in Art. 26, paragraph 14 of Law Decree no. 76 of 16 July 2020 were identified by the Decree of 30 May 2022 of the Ministry for Technological Innovation and Digital Transition, published in Official Journal General Series no. 180 of 3 August 2022. The decree states that the amount of the costs of notification for the addressee of the document served is set at €2.00 for each notification effected via the platform. A portion of the amount, to be negotiated with PagoPa, will be paid to Poste Italiane as the platform provider. There is also an additional charge of €1.40 to Poste Italiane as universal service provider in cases of delivery of the hard copy of the documents to be served.

Poste Italiane, at the request of PagoPA, is contributing to the implementation of the platform, also through the use of its own services, on the basis of an agreement, currently being finalised, that will govern the scope of services, responsibilities and economic remuneration.

<sup>23.</sup> EU2 areas: extra-urban delivery areas where there are no competitors of Poste Italiane.

| Regulation of public<br>procurement of postal<br>services                 | In May 2022, following an extensive consultation process that began in 2020, the measure of the Na<br>tional Authority for Anti-Corruption (ANAC) and AGCom was published in the Official Journal,<br>containing the "Guidelines for the assignment of public procurement of postal services" (ANAC<br>Resolution no. 185/2022 of 13 April 2022). The document contains operational guidelines for both<br>sub-contractor organisations that have to draw up calls for tenders and for postal operators wishing<br>to participate in public procurement procedures for the awarding of postal services. The document, in<br>force since 19 May 2022, although not binding, will form the basis for the construction of public<br>tenders for postal services and will provide economic operators with the interpretative guidelines for<br>formulating offers. |

## Market context

#### Financial markets

Overall, 2022 was a particularly difficult year for both equity and bond investors. The capital markets reflected this scenario in their stock prices, with bond and share prices falling simultaneously, an event that has occurred only once in the last 50 years (1994); global stock markets have lost 19.4% since the beginning of the year27, while bond markets have fallen by 13.7%28. Stock market performance was driven by a decline in market29 multiples while earnings estimates remained relatively stable in both the EU and the US, helped in part by the energy sector and the ability of some companies to pass on to their customers the increased production costs resulting from higher commodity prices. In 2022, the S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 indexes30 lost roughly 20% and 9%, respectively, while the EuroStoxx 50 lost around 12%.

The cycle of central bank rate hikes has led to a significant repricing of the European bond segment: the yield on the 10-year multi-year Treasury bond (BTP), which stood at around 1.2% at the start of the year, has progressively increased, reaching 4.8% in October, the highest level of the year. At the same time, the BTP-BUND spread also rose, reaching 250 basis points in October. From mid-October to mid-December, yields on long-term government bonds in the major advanced economies (in particular, the US, Europe, the UK) fell significantly, returning to values close to the yields recorded in the first half of 2022. Contributing to this development was the easing of the central banks' monetary policy tightening process, which changed traders' expectations regarding the pace and duration of the monetary tightening process. Expectations of a more decisive tightening of monetary policies spread following the December meetings of the central banks of the major advanced economies and the 10-year BTP ended 2022 with a yield of 4.7% and the BTP-Bund spread in the 210 basis point area.

In the Italian stock market, the *[FTSE MIB](#page-483-0)*  declined by 13% year-on-year in 202231.

Corporate bonds, against this backdrop of uncertainty and rising yields, rose for much of the year, particularly on the more speculative component. Towards the end of the year, however, credit spreads partially retraced, helped by a generalised reduction in volatility and a return of interest for the asset class by investors, given the levels reached by spreads in the autumn.

Below is a table that represents the precise returns expressed in percentage terms at the end of the period for BTP government bonds and Interest Rate Swaps32.

#### Spread BTP Vs BUND 10 yrs

#### Banking system

Based on the estimates provided by the Italian Banking Association (ABI), at the end of 202233 customer deposits of total banks in Italy, represented by resident customer deposits (current accounts, certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements) and bonds, decreased by 1.2% year-on-year to about €2,044 billion: compared to December 2021, deposits decreased by about €24 billion, while bond deposits remained essentially unchanged at around €209 billion.

In December 2022, the average cost of bank funding (which includes the return on deposits, bonds and repos from households and non-financial companies) was around 0.62% (0.44% in December 2021).

Bank loans in 2022 increased by about €6 billion and the aggregate of loans to the private sector in December 2022 stood at €1,479 billion, a positive annual change of 1.8%. The component of loans to households and non-financial companies was slightly more dynamic, increasing by 2.1% year-on-year in December 2022.

During 2022 there was an acceleration in the trend of interest rates on outstanding loans to households (from 2.13% to 3.22%), similarly for rates on new business transactions (from 1.18% to 3.44%) and for new loans to households for house purchases (from 1.4% to 3.09%).

#### Asset Management

Assogestioni data show total assets of €2,212 billion at 31 December 202234, down 14.7% from €2,594 billion at the end of 2021 (a result strongly influenced by the negative performance of the financial markets during the reporting period).

In terms of net funding, the asset management industry has a positive balance of approximately €14.9 billion in 2022 (compared to €93 billion in 2021).

nota fuori tabella:35,

<sup>35.</sup> The three consultation documents are as follows:

i. "Targeted consultation on the review of the revised payment services directive (PSD2)", aimed at gathering views on the possible revision of PSD2. It includes specific questions on the more technical topics of the Directive, which therefore require more in-depth knowledge and/or experience in the field of payment services;

ii. "Targeted consultation on open finance framework and data sharing in the financial sector", which speculates on the further possible development of open finance and assesses the use of aggregated supervisory data for research and innovation as well as the sharing of financial firms' data for risk monitoring or compliance purposes; iii. "Public consultation on the review of the revised payment services directive (PSD2) and on open finance", which includes general questions on the revision of the PSD2 directive and is addressed to stakeholders who do not necessarily have specific and technical knowledge in the area of payment services.

#### Other information

#### Bank of Italy

On 10 January 2022, the Bank of Italy, following a whistleblowing report, sent a request for an update on potential criticalities in the training activities of newly recruited consultants and alleged operational practices inconsistent with *[IT security criteria](#page-482-0)* . The reply report was sent on 10 March 2022.

On 20 May 2022, the Authority sent BancoPosta RFC the Measure concluding the proceedings relating to the imposition of additional capital requirements pursuant to Article 53-*bis*, paragraph 1, letter d) of Legislative Decree no. 385 of 1 September 1993 (TUB - Consolidated Law on Banking).

Specifically, as of the supervisory reporting on 30 June 2022, BancoPosta will have to hold the following minimum capital requirements: (i) CET 1 ratio: 7.80%; (ii) Tier 1 ratio: 9.55%; (iii) Total Capital Ratio: 11.95%. Moreover, in order to ensure compliance with the binding measures outlined above and to ensure that BancoPosta's own funds can absorb any losses arising from stress scenarios, taking into account the results of the stress tests carried out by the intermediary as part of the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process), the Bank of Italy has identified the following levels of capital that BancoPosta will be required to maintain: (i) CET 1 ratio: 8.55%; (ii) Tier 1 ratio: 10.30%; (iii) Total Capital Ratio: 12.70%.

Compliance with these requirements did not result in the need for additional capital contributions by BancoPosta.

On 20 July 2022, the Authority sent a notice to Poste Italiane SpA– BancoPosta RFC and Poste-Pay concerning the manner in which the funds received by PostePay in respect of the issuance of electronic money should be managed. It should be noted that the Supervisory Provisions for EMI provide that such funding may be deposited with a bank authorised to operate in Italy, invested in qualified debt securities or particular units of harmonised mutual funds. Since the creation of PostePay, these sums are deposited in a postal current account (protection account) and contribute to the funds from private customers of BancoPosta RFC, which are invested in euro area government bonds. In this regard, the Authority initiated discussions with BancoPosta and Poste-Pay in 2021, in view of the fact that BancoPosta was not deemed to be an entity that could be assimilated to the concept of "credit institution" under the relevant European legislation. In the face of a proposed alternative approach, aimed at equating the deposit with BancoPosta of the sums collected by PostePay with a direct investment in qualified debt securities, in the aforementioned communication the Authority asked BancoPosta and PostePay for further observations, aimed at identifying an operational solution that would allow full alignment with the relevant regulatory provisions. Upon completion of the further investigations requested, a transitional solution was identified, also on the basis of the discussions with the Authority. Feedback will be provided by BancoPosta by the second quarter of 2023.

The Bank of Italy, from 14 March 2022 to 15 July 2022, conducted an inspection at Poste Italiane SpA - BancoPosta RFC, on profitability and the business model, governance and control systems, interest rate risk management methods including related internal modelling, new tax credit business and associated risks. For further details, please refer to the chapter "Proceedings pending and principal relations with the Authorities" in the section "Poste Italiane's Financial Statements".

On 10 August 2022, the Bank of Italy launched a survey on the use of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) and crypto-assets, in order to have an updated and complete picture of the spread of these technologies in the Italian banking and financial system. BancoPosta, in coordination with PostePay (also a recipient of the questionnaire), replied on 13 September 2022.

#### CONSOB In March 2022, CONSOB launched a second43 thematic survey concerning the provision of cryptocurrency services by intermediaries, with a focus on investments/financial instruments with underlying cryptocurrencies placed on behalf of customers together with any project activities planned on the matter over the next three years. The feedback was provided on 1 April 2022.

In April 2022, the Authority launched a thematic investigation into the ways in which intermediaries comply with their ex-post disclosure obligations to retail customers on costs and charges incurred. The feedback was provided on 4 July 2022.

On 6 July 2022, CONSOB sent a request for an update on specific aspects (customer profiling and concentration risk), previously addressed in the feedback provided (on 16 July 2021 and 11 February 2022 respectively), following the technical report with the results of the inspections conducted by the Authority from January to October 2020. The reply was provided on 3 August 2022.

On 26 January 2023, CONSOB sent a further request for an update on the feedback provided in August. The reply was provided on 10 March 2023.

For the main pending proceedings and further relations with the Authorities, please refer to the chapter "Proceedings pending and principal relations with the Authorities" in the section "Poste Italiane's Financial Statements.

#### SEGMENT OPERATING REVIEW PILLAR

January 2022 saw the launch of distribution of the Fund "BancoPosta Focus Ambiente Marzo 2028", a balanced bond product targeting the potential growth of economic sectors related to environmental protection.

The distribution of the fund "Focus Nuovi Consumi 2028" also kicked off, which provides equity exposure linked to the emerging theme of new consumption (such as e-commerce).

As of May 2022, for the three Funds "Azionario Flessibile", "Orizzonte Reddito" and "Azionario Internazionale', the investment policy was integrated to also take into account environmental, social and governance sustainability factors.

Asset management

The Fund "BancoPosta Obbligazionario Italia 6 anni" was launched, which aims to achieve - over a time horizon of approximately 6 years (maturity 31 December 2028) - a portfolio return in line with that expressed on average by corporate and government bond financial instruments of similar duration, through an investment in euro-denominated securities mainly of Italian issuers.

The Fund "BancoPosta Investo Protetto 2028" has been launched. This is a flexible fund with a duration of around 6 years that combines two components, one bond and one equity, and aims to protect the capital invested while taking advantage of growth opportunities offered by the financial markets.

The placement of "Poste Gestione Patrimoniale", a portfolio management arrangement in collaboration with Moneyfarm, has been launched. It features 4 diversified ETF investment lines, calibrated according to customers' risk propensity and investment objectives, and characterised by an investment policy geared towards ESG factors.

Asset under Administration

In June 2022, Poste Italiane participated in the placement of the 17th issue of the Buono del Tesoro Poliennal *[(BTP)](#page-482-0)*  Italia, (BTP, Multi-year Treasury Bond Italy), a security linked to Italian inflation trends with the new features of the double loyalty bonus (paid on two occasions, during and at the end of the bond life) and with a duration of 8 years; in November 2022, the Company participated in the placement of the 18th issue of the BTP Italia, also indexed to Italian inflation and with duration of 6 years.

<sup>46.</sup> Poste Italiane has long been active in the economic and social inclusion of women who are victims of violence, and this initiative is aimed at women on certified protection schemes who are in economic difficulty. In agreement with the partner banks, in order to reach potentially interested people who are not easily accessible, the Company advertised this possibility through internal and external channels (in addition to the local area offices, associations dealing with gender-based violence were also involved). 47. This is the loan for civil servants and pensioners, which can be used to pay off other loans with a repayment of up to one fifth of salary or pension.

<sup>48.</sup> The "Advance" functionality allows you to request an advance of part of the financed amount. This amount can be disbursed after the positive approval of the case and before the approval of the Transferred Third Party Administration (one's employer or social security institution), thus eliminating the waiting time for this document, which is only necessary for the disbursement of the balance to the customer.

New request for the tax codes of policyholders to cross-reference with the Tax Registry in order to ascertain the possible death of policyholders - New request for the tax codes of policyholders to cross-reference with the Tax Registry in order to ascertain the possible death of policyholders - IVASS has announced that, pending the definition of the procedures for direct access by insurance companies to the information from the Tax Registry or the ANPR (National Resident Population Registry) provided for in the legislation on dormant policies, the Authority also offers this year to companies, in the interest of policy beneficiaries, the cross-referencing service between tax codes of policyholders and the Tax Registry, in cooperation with the Italian Revenue Agency, in order to verify the existence of life and accidents policies55.

It therefore requests the companies involved to provide, by 20 December 202256 the lists of the tax codes of the policyholders of the above-mentioned contracts in force on 30 November 2022 held in their portfolios and issued during the year.

Temporary suspension of capital losses for non-durable securities

Consultation Document no. 1/2023 contains the intended changes:

- z to IVASS Regulation no. 52/2022, following the entry into force of Decree Aid Quater57 by virtue of which only insurance companies were allowed to deduct from the amount of the unavailable reserve the portion, attributable to policyholders, of the non-impairment of securities, referring to the year of the financial statements and up to the five subsequent years (*[Shadow](#page-486-0)  [accounting](#page-486-0)* ). The amendment has the effect of tying up a smaller part of the company's equity allowing for a higher distribution of profits;
- z to ISVAP Regulation no. 38/2011, in particular, Article 8, paragraph 2, to clarify that, in determining the minimum amount of assets to be compared to the mathematical provisions of policies pertaining to a separately managed account, companies must refer to Local Gaap criteria even if they prepare their financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards. Poste Vita already draws up its financial statements according to Local Gaap accounting standards, therefore it is not impacted by the aforementioned legislation.

Following the conclusion of the consultation procedure, IVASS issued the Measure no. 127 of 14/02/2023., which made amendments to IVASS Regulation no. 52/2022 and ISVAP Regulation no. 38/2011 for the implementation of the provisions on the temporary suspension of capital losses for non-durable securities, following the amendments to Law Decree Aiuti Quater, through which the legislator, for insurance companies only, provided for the possibility of deducting from the amount of the unavailable reserve the portion, attributable to the policyholders, of the non-impairment of securities, referring to the year of the financial statements and up to the five subsequent years (shadow accounting). This amendment has the effect of tying up a smaller part of the company's equity allowing for a higher distribution of profits.

This intervention also made amendments to ISVAP Regulation no. 38/2011 to clarify that, in determining the minimum amount of assets to be compared to the mathematical provisions of policies pertaining to a separately managed account, companies must refer to Local Gaap criteria even if they prepare their financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards.

## Market context

The latest available data59 on the Italian payment card market show significant growth of the total domestic transactions, which in September 2022 were close to €265 billion, an increase of 17% compared to September 2021 due to the recovery in consumption. The number of transactions grew by 18% over the same period last year to 5.6 billion, a sign of an increasingly consolidated daily use of cards, also thanks to a greater propensity and acceptance of the use of *[digital payments](#page-483-0)* by merchants (e-commerce and *[contactless](#page-482-0)* payments ). *[Debit card transactions](#page-483-0)* grew by 24% compared to September 2021 and accounted for more than half of

~€265 billion

value of card transactions in the first 9 months of 2022 in Italy: +17% year-on-year

the total transactions (about 60%), with transactions exceeding €155 billion (+21% compared to September 2021). Also *[prepaid](#page-485-0)  [cards](#page-485-0)* are advancing at a fast pace (+18% of transactions and +19% in terms of value compared to September 2021), for a total amount of more than €46 billion, thanks to the steady development of e-commerce and increased penetration at physical points. The first nine months of 2022 were also positive for *[credit cards](#page-482-0)* , ending the period on an upward trend with transactions up 3.9% and value up 8.3% compared to September 2021, with a total amount of almost €64 billion and an average ticket at levels recorded at the end of 2021.

At 30 September 2022, the number of active cards on the market exceeded 93 million, up 1.5% compared to the stock of active cards at 31 December 2021: the greatest growth was recorded on debit cards, which grew by 2% compared to 31 December 2021, totalling almost 48 million active cards. Also on the rise is the stock of prepaid cards, surpassing 30 million (+1% compared to the figure at the end of December 2021) and growth also resumed in credit cards (+0.4% compared to 31 December 2021) with over 15 million active cards.

According to the latest available figures60, Mobile telephony market penetration, in terms of total mobile lines, stands at approximately 181% of the population, with MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators) accounting for 14.861. Total lines at 30 September 2022 amounted to 107.1 million (+1,3% compared to the same period in 2021) including 28.6 million *[Machine to](#page-484-0)  [Machine (M2M)](#page-484-0)* SIMs (+2.8% compared to the same period of 2021).

During the year, the energy market was heavily impacted by the international geopolitical context: firstly, the Covid-19 pandemic and, in recent months, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict are influencing the markets and prices of raw materials, primarily gas, with significant repercussions on the electricity62 market The price of wholesale gas, already from the last quarter of 2021, has risen sharply as a result of the recovery related to the improvement of the pandemic scenario and the increase in international tensions, which escalated in February 2022 in the above-mentioned conflict. The price of gas surpassed the level recorded in the first half of 2021 by more than 500%63; the third quarter of 2022 was also characterised by a scenario of significant tensions on energy commodity prices, which were even higher than in the second quarter of the year: the very high purchase costs and elevated price volatility are also related to uncertainties about the reliability of gas supplies from Russia.

During the summer, European gas stocks grew rapidly while alternative sources to gas (hydro, nuclear and coal) had to significantly reduce their production due to high temperatures and water shortages; the European institutions announced measures64 to deal with high energy prices and the risk of gas shortages as the winter season approached (plan to reduce electricity and gas consumption, intervention in the regulation and operation of energy markets, evaluation of "price cap" mechanisms for energy prices).

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the price of gas fell to around €80 per megawatt-hour, thanks to the achievement of the storage targets of the major European countries, although it was seven times higher than the level observed at the beginning of 2021.

In order to cope with rising commodity prices, the Government issued a series of emergency measures with the aim of mitigating the energy expenditure of households and businesses, in particular by making changes to general system charges and social bonuses for economically disadvantaged households and customers in serious health conditions. For more details on the regulatory interventions implemented, see below.

| TLC<br>International<br>Roaming   | On 24 February 2021, the European Commission proposed to extend the existing International<br>Roaming Regulation for an additional 10 years (until 30 June 2032), while reducing the maximum<br>wholesale rates charged between operators to ensure the sustainability of the provision of retail<br>roaming services at domestic prices, while also introducing new measures to increase transparen<br>cy and ensure an effective roaming experience at domestic rates ("roam-like-at-home") in terms of<br>quality of service and access to emergency roaming services. The reduction of the wholesale caps<br>has a relevant impact for a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) such as PostePay, which pur<br>chases roaming services from a mobile network operator (MNO), insofar as it allows the provision<br>of services (roam-like-at-home) to their respective customers while ensuring the recovery of costs<br>incurred at wholesale level. The current EU Regulation will cease to have effect from 30 June 2022. |
|                                   | The new Regulation came into force on 1 July 2022, and BEREC (Body of European Regulators<br>for Electronic Communications) subsequently published guidelines to define certain aspects of the<br>implementation of the new rules. The text of the new regulation was approved by the Parliament<br>on 24 March 2022 and by the Council on 6 April 2022 (Regulation 2022/612 was published in the<br>Official Journal of the European Union on 13 April 2022). The text confirms the basic principles of<br>the existing Regulation and provides for progressive reductions in wholesale price caps for data,<br>voice and SMS roaming services consistent with the Company's estimates; it also provides for<br>additional transparency, customer protection and service quality assurance measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Grants for Electronic Communication Operators

Under the EU Directive 2015/2366 (PSD2) and Legislative Decree no. 218/2017, it is set forth that providers of electronic communications networks or services, operating under the exemption65 regime from the full application of PSD2, may offer end-customers electronic communication services that enable payment transactions by charging the costs of accessing the services either on the bill (postpaid electronic communication services) or on the prepaid telephone account (prepaid/ rechargeable electronic communication services).

Operators will also have to notify the competent authorities that they are operating under an exemption regime so that they can assess whether or not the requirements are met (Article 37, Directive 2015/2366).

On 5 April 2022, the Bank of Italy issued the "Measure implementing Article 2, paragraph 4-bis, of Legislative Decree no. 11 of 27 January 2010, concerning payment services", repealing the obligation for providers of electronic communication networks or services to report annually to the Bank of Italy the "number of users of the services and the total value of payment transactions". This amendment is effective as of 17 April 2022.

The obligations of first notification, at the registration stage, and of updating the information, as well as the possibility for the Bank of Italy to request - should it deem it necessary - a new notification containing updated information remain unaffected.

Therefore, as of 17 April 2022, PostePay is no longer required to report this information annually.

2022/2023 Budget Law

In order to contain price increases in the electricity and natural gas sectors, Law Decree no. 234 of 30 December 2021, the 2022 Budget Law, made provision for the following for the first quarter of 2022:

- z the zeroing of general charges for domestic electric and other customers;
- z the reduction of general charges for the natural gas sector;
- z an increase in the amounts of social bonuses for electricity and gas.

The aforementioned decree also provided for the reduction of VAT to 5% for the supply of gas for domestic use and the obligation for electricity and gas sales companies to offer domestic customers an interest-free instalment plan in the event of non-payment of bills issued in the period between 1 January and 30 June 2022.

These concessions were substantially extended to the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and the first quarter of 202366 (Law Decree no. 17 of 1 March 2022, Law Decree no. 21 of 21 March 2022, Law Decree no. 80 of 30 June 2022, "Aiuti Bis" Law Decree no. 115 of 9 August 2022 and Law Decree no. 197 of 29 December 2022. 2023 Budget Law). The "Aiuti Bis" Law Decree also intervenes by suspending, until 30 April 2023, the effectiveness of contractual clauses that allow electricity and gas sellers to unilaterally change the general terms and conditions of contracts relating to price definition (changes notified to customers before 10 August 2022 are also rendered ineffective, unless they have already been finalised by that date).

The aforementioned decree, in view of the end of regulated gas prices, initially scheduled for 1 January 2023 (Law Decree no. 176 of 18 November 2022, so called "Aiuti Quater", extended the deadline to 10 January 2024, aligning it with the deadline for the "Maggior Tutela elettrica") also redefined the perimeter of "vulnerable"67 customers providing that from 1 January 2023, suppliers must make available an offer for the supply of natural gas at contractual and economic conditions that will be defined by ARERA with one or more ad hoc measures. In particular, the economic conditions will have to reflect the actual cost of supply on the wholesale market and the efficient costs of marketing.

<sup>65.</sup> Exempt payment transactions are permitted for the purchase of digital content and voice technology services (regardless of the device used); the performance of charitable activities or the purchase of tickets (made from or via an electronic device), provided that, per individual customer (postpaid or rechargeable): the value of each individual payment transaction is no more than €50; the total value of the payment transactions is no more than €300 per month.

<sup>66.</sup> The tariff concessions envisaged to curb the effects of customer bill increases have been extended, although the zeroing of general electricity sector charges has been limited to customers with available power up to 16.5 kW. In addition, the band of beneficiaries eligible for social bonuses has been widened because the ISEE level required to benefit from them, for 2023, rises to €15,000 (from the previous €12,000), and the threshold to €20,000 for large families.

<sup>67.</sup> The new perimeter of "vulnerable" customers also includes those in economically disadvantaged conditions, persons with disabilities, customers with utilities on noninterconnected minor islands or in emergency housing facilities following calamitous events, and customers over 75 years of age.

ARERA Initiatives

The above-mentioned government interventions were implemented, to the extent of their competence, by the Regulatory Authority for Energy Networks and Environment (ARERA), with Resolutions 635/2021/R/com of 30 December 2021, 141/2022/R/com of 30 March 2022 and 241/2022/R/com of 31 May 2022.

With Resolution 636/2021/R/com of 30 December 2021, ARERA implemented the provisions concerning the aforementioned obligation to pay bills in instalments for domestic end users of electricity and natural gas.

During the course of 2022 ARERA issued further significant measures for the sector incorporating electricity and natural gas sales to end customers, among which the following are highlighted:

- z resolutions 146/2022/R/eel and 147/2022/R/gas updated, for 2022, the value of the marketing and sales components of electricity and natural gas, respectively, for customers served in the protected service68. The valuation of these components has an impact not only for sellers operating in the protected market and that bill these costs to the extent determined by ARERA, but also for those operating in the free market, where the regulated prices serve in any case as a term of reference in the process of defining the prices of offers;
- z resolution 135/2022/R/com standardised the way "offer codes"69 are defined so as to contain summary information on certain characteristics of the offer, easily identifiable and usable for the collection of information also at an aggregate level on the characteristics of the offers subscribed to by customers;
- z resolution 374/2022/R/gas, which came into force on 1 October 2022, modified the methods for determining the price of gas for customers belonging to the protected market, providing that the price of gas is indexed to the Virtual Trading Point70, i.e. the reference price of gas on the Italian wholesale market. As a result of this change, reference is no longer made to quotations recorded at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF)71 hub and forward quotations, but rather to the monthly average of actual prices on the Italian wholesale market, and the frequency of price updates is increased (from quarterly to monthly);
- z resolution no. 637/2022/R/com, contains further changes to the mandatory information content of customer bills, with development obligations on the part of operators starting in 2023. In particular, a number of changes are made to the way readings are presented in the bill, to the information on how details and the Guide to Reading Your Bill are made available, to the unbundling of cost items relating to electricity system charges, and finally, a special space is provided for communications from ARERA.

## 5.1 Integrating sustainability within Poste Italiane's strategy

NFS

To be sustainable for Poste Italiane means defining a clear strategy on ESG issues and structurally incorporating them within the objectives set in the "Strategic Plan"81. Within the plan, €3.1 billion of investment is planned in strategic assets, in order to achieve financial objectives. Complementing these is the "Polis Project", which, within the framework of the PNRR (National Recovery and Resilience Plan), aims both to renovate and modernise post offices and to enhance the Group's real estate with co-working initiatives.

## Strategic Plan

MAIL, PARCELS AND DISTRIBUTION

The strategic objective of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution segment is to accelerate its transformation from a pure mail operator to a full logistics operator, ensuring the economic and environmental sustainability of its operations. Implementation of the strategy is based on streamlining of the distribution networks, including the integration of Nexive, acquired at the end of 2020, consolidation of leadership in the B2C market and growth in the C2X and B2B segments through the introduction of specific offers and initiatives aimed at improving the customer experience. With this in mind, the acquisition of Plurima strengthens the contract logistics division. Through the implementation of these strategic directions, the segment aims to achieve an operating profit in 2024.

The Payments and Mobile area aims to establish itself as a complete and omnichannel platform for its customers, flanking the traditional business lines of payments and telecommunications with an offer dedicated to Energy from 2022, a market which the Company will enter by taking advantage of its liberalisation. The acquisition of LIS, from this perspective, further contributes to the Group's omnichannel strategy. The expansion of products, together with the ability to exploit physical and digital channels and third-party networks, makes it possible to fully exploit cross-selling opportunities for customers, thereby increasing value for Poste Italiane as a whole.

Financial Services aims to further evolve its service model by combining the traditional physical model with the opportunities provided by technological innovation. The priorities of the Strategic Plan include growth in wealth management, thanks to the diversification of customer portfolios to optimise their risk-return profile, the integration of P&C policies within the advisory model and a renewed focus on loans, with particular emphasis on the salary-backed loan segment, also thanks to partnerships signed with leading operators in the sector. The business related to the purchase of building bonus tax credits represents an opportunity to diversify the investment portfolio.

In Insurance Services, Poste Italiane aims to establish itself as an insurance operator capable of serving all customers' investment and protection needs. Poste Vita aims to confirm its position as leader in the Life insurance sector, continuing to offer customers safe products that are both more profitable and more capital efficient. Lastly, the P&C insurance strategy envisages an increase in profitability thanks to the modular offer, supplemented by car insurance, provided to customers without assuming risk thanks to distribution agreements signed with leading Italian insurance companies.

## 5.2 Poste Italiane's Sustainability Strategy

Poste Italiane's Sustainability Strategy, consisting of the ESG Strategic Plan and a set of Sustainability Policies, is aimed at achieving national and international social and environmental development goals. This Strategy is consistent with Poste Italiane's activities and business criteria, within the broader strategic framework defined by the Group.

The ESG Strategic Plan encompasses all the specific objectives and targets, both qualitative and quantitative, that the Group has set for the purpose of continuously improving its sustainability performance. In addition, the policies adopted incorporate all the principles, qualitative objectives and different management methods, regulating in a synergistic manner the various issues that emerged from the materiality analysis and the areas required by Legislative Decree no. 254/2016 is not established.

## Material sustainability themes for Poste Italiane

Poste Italiane has developed a materiality analysis process aimed at identifying priority issues, based on the significance of their related impacts, to be included in the Group's Sustainability Strategy and to be formalised in terms of policies and targets.

With a view to continuous improvement, Poste Italiane perfected what it started in 2021 by revising the materiality analysis methodology, aligning it with the forecasts contained in the 2021 update of the GRI standards for the inside-out perspective, and took into account the provisions of the EFRAG, albeit still in draft, for the outside-in perspective, by carrying out a dual materiality exercise in advance of the entry into force scheduled for FY 2024.

The definition process of material topics, last approved by the Board of Directors, consisted of the following 3 stages:

To identify current and potential positive and negative impacts, an in-depth scenario analysis was conducted on the Group's activities, its business relations, the sustainability context in which it operates and the expectations of its stakeholders. In particular, the analysis took into account the provisions of regulatory sources and the main international sustainability guidelines, the Strategic Plan and the Group's risk management model, as well as the requirements of the main questionnaires prepared by ESG rating agencies and analyses of current industry trends.

In particular, the analysis took into account the provisions of regulatory sources and the main international sustainability guidelines, the Strategic Plan and the Group's risk management model, as well as the requirements of the main questionnaires prepared by ESG

The definition process of material topics, last approved by the Board of Directors, consisted of the following 3 stages:

According to the inside-out perspective, the Company has considered the significant current or potential impacts on people and the environment directly related to its activities, products and services, including upstream and downstream activities in its value chain. On the other hand, the outside-in perspective took into account sustainability risks and opportunities that may positively or negatively influence future cash flows and thus create or erode corporate value in the short, medium or long term, affecting its development, performance and positioning.

## Stakeholder engagement

In order to contribute to the creation of shared value for the Company and all its stakeholders, Poste Italiane integrates the variable visions and needs of those directly and indirectly involved in the Group's activities within its Sustainability Strategy. Consideration of stakeholders' requests allows the Group to strengthen its growth in terms of reputation and, at the same time, maintain a relationship of trust and transparency in the social and economic context in which it operates.

In order to identify all the stakeholders who influence or are in turn influenced by the process of achieving the Group's strategic objectives, Poste Italiane has conducted a thorough mapping of the categories of stakeholders with whom it interacts in the course of its activities, in accordance with the AA1000-Stakeholder Engagement International Standard (SES). The analysis enabled the identification of seven macro-categories of stakeholders, namely: Shareholders and Investors, Local Communities (trade associations, media, academia), Customers (consumer associations), Entities and Institutions (regulators, Fondimpresa), Suppliers (business partners), Personnel (Poste Italiane people, labour unions) and the Environment.

The seven macrocategories of stakeholders are shown in the following table, which indicates the main ways of engagement and communication related to each of them.

## The Multistakeholder Forum 2022

The Multistakeholder Forum, which takes place every year, is one of the most effective tools to engage and dialogue with stakeholders and represents a fundamental moment of reflection and discussion on priority Sustainability issues for the Group.

{113}------------------------------------------------

The sixth edition of the Multistakeholder Forum, live streamed in order to ensure the widest possible participation, was attended by around 1,100 stakeholders, more than double the number of the previous year, and represented an important opportunity to exchange views with the Group's main stakeholders on strategies, sustainable development issues and the integration of these within the Company's business projects defined in the Strategic Plan.

During the event, participants took part in five focus groups related to the eight Pillars of Sustainability. During the event, participants took part in five focus groups related to the eight Pillars of Sustainability. In particular, the first Focus Group, mainly addressed to Suppliers and Business Partners, focused on the Pillars "Integrity and transparency" and "Green transition"; the second Focus Group, mainly addressed to Customers, focused on the "Customer experience" and "Innovation" pillars; the third Focus Group, conducted in English and mainly addressed to Suppliers and Business Partners, Shareholders and Investors, focused exclusively on the "Sustainable finance" pillar in order to analyse in depth the issue of integrating ESG factors within the Group's insurance and investment policies; the fourth Focus Group, aimed at Employees, was dedicated to "People development" and "Diversity and inclusion" pillars; the fifth Focus Group, aimed primarily at Institutional Bodies and Communities and Territory, finally focused on the "Creating value for the country" pillar.

Participants in the Forum expressed their judgments on material issues for the Company through a digital tool accessible from smartphones and PCs that enabled the instant and dynamic display of the results.

The results of the engagement process of the Group's key stakeholders revealed a greater significance of the impacts underlying the following topics: innovation and digitisation, environmental impacts of logistics and cybersecurity with regard to the insideout perspective; innovation and digitisation, staff training and development and integrity and transparency with regard to the outside-in perspective.

{114}------------------------------------------------

## Materiality matrix

The materiality matrix, shown below, graphically represents the result of the process of identifying priority issues starting from the assessment of the significance of the impacts related to them, according to a dual perspective: inside-out and outside-in. Each of the 18 material themes is in fact associated with an impact materiality value (inside-out perspective) and a financial materiality value (outside-in perspective), as a product of the magnitude and probability of the individual impacts pertaining to the same material theme. The order of priority of the topics was defined on the basis of the values obtained and through the definition of a materiality threshold.

The matrix is an effective tool to support the Group's Sustainability Strategy and is the result of the alignment process to the new GRI provisions for the inside-out perspective, which is also influenced by the provisions, still in draft, issued by EFRAG, for the outside-in perspective.

## The Group's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Strategic Plan

Poste Italiane's ESG Strategic Plan consists of 8 pillars in the ESG areas relevant for the Group. The materiality analysis, held during the Multistakeholder Forum in December 2022, enabled the identification of priority topics on the basis of the significance of their related impacts, to be included in the Group's Sustainability Strategy. Each Pillar is based on specific objectives and targets that contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Please refer to chapter 7 "Creation of value", for further information on the objectives, management methods and performances achieved within the Pillars of the Group's ESG Strategic Plan.

Through the Strategic Plan, Poste Italiane aims to achieve responsible growth and accompany the country's path of sustainability and social inclusion. In defining the investment choices of the Plan, the contribution of each intervention to the Group's 8 Sustainability Pillars was also assessed.

The Company is committed to creating shared value on a daily basis, also in relation to the achievement of the SDGs, and aims to move the country towards carbon neutrality by 2030. In particular, through initiatives such as the so-called Green Challenge, which includes entering the energy market with an offer 100% from renewable sources and offsetting CO2 emissions through the development of ad hoc tools, Poste Italiane is able to best communicate the innovative green business philosophy adopted by the Group, i.e. a holistic approach that incorporates all Poste Italiane's products, services and processes.

{127}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane, being an integral part of a network of associations operating nationally and internationally that aims to seek continuous stimuli and opportunities for discussion on sustainability issues, is able to propose a strategy in step with the evolution of the global context on ESG matters.

UN Global Compact: the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world. An appeal to companies to align their strategies and operations with universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption and to take actions that promote society's objectives. It is a universal voluntary initiative to implement the principles of sustainability and adopt measures to support the goals of the United Nations.

Principles for Responsible Investment: the PRIs are a set of six principles that set out the main actions to be taken by investors and provide specific tools (e.g. frameworks, guidelines) aimed at incorporating environmental, social and and governance (ESG) factors within traditional investment policies.

Principles for Sustainable Insurance: the PSIs are a voluntary initiative, supported by the United Nations, aimed at addressing risks and opportunities relating to ESG issues in the insurance sector. Launched in 2012, the PSIs are aligned and complement the principles of the UN Global Compact.

UN Women: is the UN entity dedicated to gender equality and empowerment of women. UN Women was established to accelerate progress in meeting their needs around the world. In particular it supports UN member states as they define global standards to achieve gender equality and work with governments and civil society to design the laws, policies, programmes and services needed to ensure that the standards are effectively implemented and truly benefit women and girls around the world.

CSR Exhibition: is the most important event in Italy dedicated to sustainability. It is an opportunity to share ideas and find common paths through dozens of meetings, hundreds of speakers and thousands of visitors. The exhibition allows getting to know the companies that have made sustainability a strategic driver, meeting young people, helping build the future of CSR. The exhibition takes place for two days, which are intense thanks to a rich cultural programme, many stimulating appointments, many opportunities for networking.

Sodalitas: established in 1995 on the initiative of Assolombarda, this foundation was the first organisation to promote corporate sustainability in Italy, by contributing to the development of the role of companies as social as well as economic players, and putting the strengths of corporate culture at the service of civil society. A unique organisation in Italy, it brings together the commitment of more than 100 leading companies and a group of volunteer managers, and is a reference point for companies that consider sustainability to be a vital strategic dimension. It has gained respect as a partner of European institutions for implementing the sustainability agenda in Italy, and stands out for its ability to implement multi-stakeholder initiatives for generating shared social value.

Anima per il Sociale: an association that brings together a group of managers and companies with the mission of spreading the culture of corporate social responsibility and sustainability among local companies, at an economic, social and environmental level. The partnership enables the Group to access the association's network- consisting of large companies, associations, non-profit organisations, bodies and authorities - in order to keep up to date through monitoring, communication and training activities and by participating in Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives and events.

{128}------------------------------------------------

CSR Manager: a network made up of professionals working in all kinds of organisations (companies, business foundations, trade bodies, the Public Administration, non-profit entities) who manage social, environmental and sustainability issues relating to business activities. This network of association provides the opportunity to participate in conferences held, access documents and studies prepared by the network and share best practices with the other members.

Valore D: founded in 2009, this is the first association of companies to promote women's diversity, talent and leadership in support of greater gender balance within its 150 member organisations. This collaboration enables Poste Italiane, as a supporting member since 2012, to actively participate in programmes and workshops organised by the association, as well as to take part in benchmarks and the sharing of best practices regarding the issues of diversity management, achievement of work-life balance and welfare.

ASPHI: an organisation that has been promoting the integration of disabled people in schools, employment and companies via the use of ICT technology for over 30 years. The collaboration with Poste Italiane has been consolidated over several years, in relation to participation in programmes for the inclusion and enhancement of disabled people in corporate environments.

MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

Being an essential driver in the Group's strategic and financial choices, sustainability is an integral component of Poste Italiane's activities, processes and strategy.

Over the past few years, the Group has embarked on an ambitious path to consolidate its Sustainability Strategy, given the importance it attaches to it; this Sustainability Strategy, in fact, is aimed at creating shared value for Poste Italiane's stakeholders and on its own reputational growth.

The Group is therefore committed to disseminating a corporate culture focused on sustainable issues, which are concretely implemented according to three main guidelines - Reporting, Strategy and Governance. From the very beginning, the efforts undertaken have allowed the achievement of important evolutionary changes and, at the same time, have enabled Poste Italiane to achieve numerous prestigious national and international goals.

## The value of the reputation and the Sustainability Indices in which Poste Italiane is present

In the current context, the creation of value is increasingly based on intangible capital; therefore, Poste Italiane considers reputation to be a fundamental asset capable of guiding the decisions of its stakeholders. A good corporate reputation not only reinforces trust in the Company but also increases its competitiveness. To this end, the Group has decided to follow up on its commitment by confirming its traditional vocation of being close to the territory and the community, even more so at a difficult time similar to the current national and international context.

Thanks to the considerable efforts made by Poste Italiane and the effectiveness of the strategic choices made, aimed at consolidating the Group's image and reputation, the Company has won numerous awards and recognitions in recent years.

In 2022, Poste Italiane affirmed its presence in important sustainability indices, which are valid parameters both in terms of communicating results to stakeholders and for assessing and possibly improving the Group's internal performance.

Sustainability indices, in fact, are used with a twofold purpose: on the one hand, they are used by shareholders and stakeholders as a reference tool for evaluating the Company's sustainability performance compared to other market players, and on the other hand, they are used for internal analyses conducted by Company management with the aim of developing the Group's sustainable investment plans.

The Corporate Governance structure reflects the provisions of Legislative Decree no. 58 of 24 February 1998 (TUF – Consolidated Law on Finance), where applicable, the Supervisory Provisions issued by the Bank of Italy applicable to Poste Italiane concerning business conducted through the BancoPosta Ring-Fenced Capital, the regulations applicable to electronic payment institutions for activities performed by Poste Italiane in execution of the agreements signed with PostePay – ring-fenced EMI, as well as the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code (that came into effect on 1 January 2021, replacing the previous Corporate Governance Code issued by Borsa Italiana and applicable up until 31 December 2020).

Poste Italiane has adopted a traditional governance model, separating the roles of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors. The Company's accounts are audited by an independent auditing firm.

Poste Italiane's financial management is overseen by the Italian Court of Auditors (Law 259 of 21 March 1958); the relevant controls are conducted by a Magistrate appointed by the Court of Auditors, who attends meetings of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors.

The Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors are elected and dismissed by the Shareholders' Meeting, which is also responsible for engaging the independent auditor and determining the related fees. The Shareholders' Meeting also approves the annual financial statements, amendments to the Company's By-laws and transactions of a non-recurring nature, such as rights issues, mergers and demergers in cases where the law does not grant the relevant authority to the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors consists of nine members (eight non-executives and one executive) and normally meets once a month to examine and resolve regarding the operating performance and vote on resolutions regarding the results of operations, proposals relating to the organisational structure and transactions of strategic importance. The Board met 14 times in 2022. Of the nine members of the Board, six meet the independence requirements of the TUF, the By-laws and the new Corporate Governance Code.

In accordance with the provisions of the Italian Civil Code, the Board of Directors has delegated certain executive powers to the Chief Executive Officer and has established, in accordance with the recommendations in the Corporate Governance Code and the Bank of Italy's supervisory standards, five Board Committees to provide recommendations and advice: the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Control and Risk Committee, the Sustainability Committee and the Related and Connected Parties Committee.

The role of the Chairwoman of the Board of Directors is to lead and oversee the Board of Directors. She is the Company's legal representative and exercises the powers provided for by law and the Company's By-laws, and those assigned by the Board of Directors' meeting of 15 May 2020.

The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, to whom all first-level departments report (except for the Internal Auditing function, which reports directly to the Board of Directors under the supervision – designed to act as a link with the Board of Directors– of the Chairwoman), has powers for the administration of the Company, unless otherwise provided for by law and the Company's By-laws and with the exception of the powers reserved to the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer is also the Company's legal representative within the scope of the powers delegated to him.

The Board of Statutory Auditors has 3 standing members and 3 alternates. The Board verifies compliance with the law, the Company's By-laws and with correct corporate governance principles, also verifying the adequacy of the organisational structure and administrative and accounting systems adopted by the Company and their functionality. During the year, the Board of Statutory Auditors met 39 times, 11 of which jointly with the Control and Risk Committee.

The Supervisory Board has three members. It is endowed with autonomous powers of initiative and control, supervises the functioning of and compliance with the Organisational Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 and updates it in line with changes in the organisational structure and the relevant regulatory framework, by making justified proposals to the Chief Executive Officer, who submits them to the Board of Directors.

The statutory audit of the accounts is entrusted for the years 2020-2028 to the auditing firm Deloitte & Touche SpA for the entire Group. The aforementioned appointment was made pursuant to Legislative Decree 39/2010 implementing Directive 2006/43/EC and European Regulation 537/2014 on public interest entities and the audit of public interest entities, in force since 17 June 2016.

With regard to BancoPosta RFC's governance, the rules governing the organisation, management and control of BancoPosta's operations are contained in the specific BancoPosta RFC Regulation in the Report on Operations of BancoPosta RFC, to which reference is made.

New Corporate Governance Code effective from 1st January 2021

5 Board committees with propositional and advisory functions

{140}------------------------------------------------

As a result of the new Supervisory Standards applicable to BancoPosta RFC, issued by the Bank of Italy on 27 May 2014, Poste Italiane, in providing financial services to the public, is comparable – for the purposes of application of corporate governance regulations – to a major bank in terms of size and operational complexity.

For further details on the corporate governance structure, reference is made to the document "Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure - Year 2022".

## Sustainability Governance

With this in mind, over the years Poste Italiane has embarked on an important path to develop its business strategy, structurally integrating it with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles and directing the Group's efforts towards the creation of shared value for stakeholders and the consolidation of its reputation. For Poste Italiane, being sustainable therefore means defining a clear strategy on ESG issues and integrating the latter across the board into the strategic objectives defined within the business plans.

The Group has adopted a sustainability strategy that brings together ESG governance, a set of sustainability policies and guidelines, part of the Company's body of regulations (which identify general principles, objectives for the future and management methods for the non-financial areas that are priorities for the Company and its stakeholders) and an ESG Strategic Plan, i.e. a set of sustainability objectives that contribute to the well-being of the country and ensure that Poste Italiane is aligned to the most ambitious common objectives defined worldwide in the field of sustainability. This strategy allows the Group to go far beyond its current regulatory obligations and play a central role in creating sustainable value for the community.

{141}------------------------------------------------

In this context, Poste Italiane adopted the Guideline "The ESG Process in the Poste Italiane Group", which describes the operation of the process of managing and integrating ESG principles within the Group through the transversal, uniform and coherent integration of the principles underlying the concept of sustainability to the various business activities and the permanent, transparent and proactive involvement of stakeholders.

The aforementioned Guideline was updated in July 2022 in order to align the document with the main leading practices on the subject and the new organisational structure of the Company.

## 6.2 Poste Italiane's integrated internal control and risk management system

## MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

In a context characterised by a high level of operational and regulatory complexity and the need to compete more and more efficiently in the reference markets, risk management and the related control systems take on a central role in the decision-making processes, with a view to creating long-term value to the benefit not only of the shareholders, but also in consideration of the interests of the other stakeholders of relevance to the Company.

The Poste Italiane's Internal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR) is a combination of tools, procedures, rules and organisational structures, designed to ensure that the business is managed in a way that is sound, fair and consistent with the corporate objectives, and to pursue sustainable success, through an adequate definitions of players, duties and responsibilities of the various corporate bodies and control functions as well as through the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the main risks, and through the structuring of adequate reporting lines to expedite the flow of information.

This system is a fundamental element of Poste Italiane's corporate governance system, as it enables the Board of Directors to guide the Company in its pursuit of long-term value creation, defining the nature and level of risk compatible with its strategic objectives, and including in its assessments all elements that may be relevant to sustainable success. In particular, in line with the main leading practices that place particular emphasis on the integration of sustainability into strategies, risk management and remuneration policies, Poste Italiane's SCIGR aims to contribute to the Company's sustainable success by defining ESG roles and responsibilities, information flows between the players involved in the internal control system and towards corporate bodies, and the methods of managing the related risks. Moreover, in order to achieve this objective, the Company has decided to promote dialogue with the relevant stakeholders, in order to ensure a constant exchange of views on business strategies and their implementation.

In line with statutory requirements and the related best practices, the SCIGR consists of three levels of control and involves a range of actors within the organisation. The first level controls identify, assess, manage and monitor the risks within their competence in relation to which they identify and implement specific treatment actions aimed at ensuring the correct performance of the operations. The second-level control units, whose role consists primarily of defining risk management models and carrying out monitoring activities, play a key role in the integration and overall functioning of the Internal Control and Risk Management System. The third level of control, represented at Poste Italiane by the Internal Auditing function, provide independent assurance on the adequacy and effective operation of the first and second level of control and, in general, on the SCIGR.

## SCIGR assurance activities

The Internal Auditing function plays an important role in the internal control and risk management system, as it is responsible for third-level control activities.

The action of the Internal Auditing function for the year 2022 continued in line with the approach adopted in previous years and was inspired by the following strategic lines:

- z safeguard the achievement of the objectives of the Business Plan and Sustainability;
- z support Group Governance;
- z promote value creation, efficiency and agile leadership.

At its meeting of 22 February 2022, the Board of Directors, having heard the prior opinions of the Risk and Control Committee and the Board of Statutory Auditors, acknowledged the SCIGR 2021 Evaluation Report by approving it and, at the same meeting, approved the Audit Plan for the year 2022. The Report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies and supervisory instructions, has taken account of the results of audits carried out in 2020 on the basis of the Audit Plans of all the Audit functions involved and the general framework of the Poste Italiane Group's SCIGR, considering the impact of organisational changes adopted, developments and events during the year. The Report provides an overall assessment of the Poste Italiane Group's Internal Control and Risk Management System in terms of "Positive Assurance", noting that, on the basis of the findings at the date of the report and for the period covered by the report, the system is, on the whole, adequate to mitigate the risks that threaten the pursuit of the Group's objectives.

{143}------------------------------------------------

At the same time, the Report provided a process-by-process representation of the main audit findings, the various contributions to strengthening the SCIGR, and a summary of the internal control activities carried out during the reporting year.

On 22 February 2022, Poste Italiane's Board of Directors also approved the 2022 Audit Plan of the Internal Auditing function, which was prepared , on the basis of a consolidated methodological approach, according to a systemic assessment of the level of potential risk of the main processes (including risks pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01) consistent with the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework and corporate objectives. The 2022 Audit Plan was set up according to a logic of assurance to the Governance and Control Bodies, as well as support to management on internal control issues, ensuring adequate and progressive coverage over time of the processes referable to the subsidiaries of the Poste Italiane Group. The approach used ensures compatibility and consistency with international internal control standards and best practices.

The strategic orientations were:

- z ensure the achievement of the Strategic Plan with respect to Industrial and Sustainability objectives;
- z promote change and process improvement in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of control systems, taking into account those considered critical/most significant by management, with an integrated approach to safety issues;
- z support Governance throughout the company and Group organisation by guaranteeing, in an integrated manner, an independent assessment activity on processes characterised by relevant regulatory constraints (Legislative Decree no. 231/ 01, Law no. 262/05) and/or specific supervisory requirements (Bank of Italy, CONSOB, IVASS, COVIP, AGCom, etc.), as well as meeting the control needs of the Group's supervised entities with particular regard to the respective reference regulations (e.g. Banco Posta, etc.).

The 2022 Audit Plan, structured to increase the dynamism and efficiency of the matrix structure by enhancing professional performance, ensured overall high three-year coverage levels for about 90% of the processes in the Audit Universe, of which about 24% are continuous auditing, many of which are subject to regulatory or supervisory constraints, and Average coverage for about 40% of the processes.

The 2022 Plan covered Insurance, Financial and Transactional product/service delivery areas (with audits of about 1,600 facilities), as well as Postal and Logistics processes (about 110 facilities). The activities envisaged also covered the main resource management processes such as IT (with audits of 14 processes/applications), real estate and purchasing (3 facilities), human resources (over 42 facilities), administrative-accounting processes (15 facilities) and various compliance areas (21 facilities). Finally, to oversee the internal control and risk management system of the entire Poste Italiane Group, 10 Group companies were audited in 2022.

The programme of activities envisaged in the 2022 Audit Plan document, taking advantage of the experience of the previous two-year period, ensured the saturation of resources also through the performance of remote audit activities; in fact, the Internal Auditing function, capitalising on the impacts generated by the health emergency for Covid-19, further increased its efforts in terms of innovation and evolution of the supporting IT tools, as well as defining and developing alternative operating methods for the performance of audit activities; this made it possible to mitigate the impact of absences generated by Covid-19, which, during 2022, increased by approximately 800% compared to the same period of the previous year.

The Internal Auditing function, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the Group's control system, further integrated the verification activities to be performed on Group companies without their own Internal Auditing function, in continuity with the lines adopted in previous years.

In line with the previous two years, for the most significant Group companies that do not have their own Internal Auditing function, these activities are regulated by specific agreements with SDA Express Courier, PosteAirCargo Srl and Postel SpA.

{144}------------------------------------------------

## Risk management and risk assessment model

Poste Italiane has adopted a Risk Management model based on the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, with the aim of providing an organic, integrated vision and an effective, standardised response to the risks to which the Group is exposed. The Group Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function (SSRCG), which forms part of the Corporate Affairs function, is responsible for ensuring that these objectives are met. This is primarily done through the definition of an integrated risk management process that relies on the coordinated involvement of all the actors in the Internal Control and Risk Management System, above all the specialist forms of second-level control, the use of standardised models and metrics based on Group-wide criteria, and the design and implementation of shared tools for assessing and managing risk. In this latter regard, the Group implemented an integrated Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) platform in 2018 to support the integrated risk management process. This IT tool assesses and manages operational risks, in accordance with Legislative Decree no. 231/01, of fraud, IT security, strategic, ESG, reputational, fiscal, physical security, Integrated Compliance, privacy and corruption as well as compliance with the rules applicable to financial and payment services. In addition, during 2022, the platform was further expanded through evolutionary implementations and the development of new functionalities with reference to existing modules. This is the tool that has enabled the Group to maximise integration of the risk management process, ensuring that risk assessment methods are shared across all the specialist second-level control functions. At the same time, it has improved communication with senior management and corporate bodies and between the various control functions, minimising the risk of inadequate or redundant information.

{145}------------------------------------------------

GROUP'S RISK MODEL

Below are the main risk categories associated with the Poste Italiane Group's activities, as identified in the Group's Risk Model.

#### STRATEGIC

This category of risk could influence achievement of the goals set out in the Strategic Plan and are identified, classified and monitored with the involvement of management from the SSRCG function. This process describes the key nature of the risks, the triggers and the potential consequences or effects, in both financial terms (e.g. losses, increased costs due to delays or the failure to implement restructuring plans and efficiencies, reduced revenue), and in other terms (e.g. customer satisfaction).

#### OPERATIONAL

Operational risks refer to the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems at Group level, or from external events. Management of operational risk takes place at both the level of specialist units within the Group (BancoPosta Risk Management and Outsourcing Governance, Poste Vita Group Risk Office and PostePay Risk Management and Compliance), in compliance with the respective supervisory standards, and at an integrated level, involving the SSRCG function. The following risks, among others, are closely monitored: i) IT risk, above all the risk that malfunctions and/or shortcomings in information systems could result in the loss of data integrity, leaks of personal data or breaches of confidentiality, potentially causing disruption to the services provided to customers; ii) health and safety risk, with specific regard to the risk of workplace injury to employees or contractors as a result of operations (e.g. the collection, transport and sorting of parcels and letter post, and the delivery of postal products using motor vehicles); iii) physical security risk, relating to access to the headquarters premises of Group companies, to post offices or other private areas by unauthorised or unidentified persons, and the limited protection of Poste Italiane's assets and property against criminal behaviour (robberies, losses resulting from fraud, theft, ATM attacks, vandalism, etc.). Operational risk also includes disruption and/or obstacles to entry to the Group's operating facilities (mail sorting centres and delivery offices, etc.) due to industrial action or strikes.

#### COMPLIANCE

This refers to risks of breaches of existing laws and regulations, such as the risks connected with Legislative Decree no. 231/01, Law 262/05, Data Protection and Market Abuse regulations or the introduction of new legislation or regulations (or new interpretations legislation and regulations) of either general importance (e.g. regarding administrative, accounting, tax matters, etc.) or specific to the sectors in which the Poste Italiane Group operates. This risk category includes the risks linked to the introduction of new regulations governing the management and development of universal postal services and the related rates providing a return for Poste Italiane, and the risk of the failure to meet the service quality standards set by the regulator (the Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni or AGCom).

{146}------------------------------------------------

#### REPUTATIONAL

This category regards the risks connected with a negative perception among the Group's stakeholders, in response to which the Group has adopted a stakeholder engagement framework in order to identify and assess this type of risk at source. The main element of reputational risk to which the Group is, by its nature, exposed is linked to market performance and primarily associated with the placement of postal savings products and investment products issued by third-party entities (bonds, certificates and real estate funds) or by Group companies (insurance policies issued by the subsidiaries, Poste Vita and Poste Assicura, and mutual funds managed by BancoPosta Fondi SGR), and those linked to the perceived and effective quality of the services related to letter post and parcel delivery.

Risks arising from factors related to environmental, social and governance issues (in particular, linked to human rights, climate change and sustainable finance).

## GROUP'S RISK MODEL

#### FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE

Financial risks that are regulated and overseen by supervisory authorities (the Bank of Italy and IVASS, the insurance industry regulator) and the responsibility of the Risk Management units belonging to the various business units, coordinated by the function responsible for Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance at Group level. Financial risk primarily relates to the operations of BancoPosta RFC and PostePay's ring-fenced EMI (the active management of the liquidity deriving from postal current account deposits, and of collections and payments carried out in the name of and on behalf of third parties), asset financing and the investment of liquidity and, as regards the Poste Vita Insurance Group, investments designed to cover contractual obligations to policyholders. Insurance risks derive from the stipulation of insurance contracts and the terms and conditions contained therein (technical bases adopted, premium calculation, the terms and conditions of cash surrender, etc.). In technical terms, mortality is one of the main risk factors for Poste Vita, i.e. any risk associated with the uncertainty of a policyholder's life expectancy, alongside the risk associated with redemptions.

{147}------------------------------------------------

With specific reference to the assessment of Poste Italiane's main risks, in addition to the customary activity of analysing the internal context, particular attention was paid to the external context, also in consideration of the country's general objectives for a sustainable economic recovery, as well as the current geopolitical context characterised by strong instability, also in light of the humanitarian and energy crisis caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In particular, the risk assessment activities first focused on the analysis of risks and opportunities related to the management of material topics, and then, on the basis of this analysis, there was an in-depth examination of some types of risks that may have a transversal impact on these topics, such as climate change, human rights protection and emerging risks. In particular, with reference to the different material topics, the following were analysed:

#### Climate change

Risks related to climate change, classified as transitional risks and physical risks, as well as related opportunities and specific mitigation actions, in view of both the impacts that phenomena related to climate change may have on Poste Italiane's business, and the impacts that Poste Italiane's activities may have on the climate (see the management of risks and opportunities relating to climate change)

#### Protection of human rights

Potential risks that may compromise respect for human rights, both within Poste Italiane's own activities and in relation to activities entrusted to third parties/conducted with partners (see Poste Italiane's commitment to managing risks relating to human rights)

#### Emerging risks

Emerging risks that consist of exogenous events with disruptive characteristics that can threaten the business model over a long time horizon and are potential gamechangers, such as the current geopolitical instability (see the management of emerging risks and the related opportunities)

#### Risks associated with material topics

Potential risks related to Poste Italiane's sustainability strategy, as well as to sustainability issues relevant to Poste Italiane identified through the materiality analysis process (see risks relating to material topics and management methods)

The main risks for Poste Italiane were analysed taking into consideration the forms of financial and non-financial capital that characterise its business model. Furthermore, these analyses were conducted by adopting the common metrics defined by the World Economic Forum, taking into account their impact on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, each risk was classified on the basis of these metrics, also highlighting their correlation with Poste Italiane's sustainability pillars and the respective material topics. An example of such assessment activity is given in the paragraph on emerging risks.

## [6](#page-137-0).4 Poste Italiane's commitment to managing human rights risks

In order to monitor and manage risks and opportunities relating to human rights in all their forms, the "Group policy for the protection of Human Rights" is a useful tool to define a clear approach to the management of Poste Italiane's activities and those entrusted to third parties or conducted with partners, confirming the Group's commitment to socially responsible investment and management.

Poste Italiane has adopted a specific "Diversity & Inclusion Policy" with the aim of fostering a corporate culture based on respect for and appreciation of diversity, in line with as already stated in the Code of Ethics and in the Group policy for the protection of Human Rights. The Policy also aims to define the modalities for creation of value within working environments, valuing diversity in all its forms and assessing the risks associated with the occurrence of discrimination within the Company.

Furthermore, the Group's risk management model envisages, through the application of risk assessment procedures, the periodic identification of business activities and organisational areas that could entail a risk of human rights violations. This process is carried out at least annually, as well as on the basis of specific requirements (e.g. prior authorisation of any corporate transaction) and is structured as follows:

- z Identification of human rights risk drivers (e.g. freedom of association, dignity and respect for human rights, discrimination, equal pay, forced labour, human trafficking, child labour, etc.);
- z identification and analysis of the most relevant drivers with respect to Poste Italiane's business;
- z Carrying out an assessment to:
	- Identify the areas most at risk of human rights violations;
	- Identify measures to mitigate this risk (e.g. certification, guidelines, policies, contractual agreements, due diligence, training, audits, etc.);
	- Define potential action plans in case such measures are absent or inadequate;
	- Monitor the implementation of action plans

The outcome of this activity is reported within the following risk heatmap in order to prioritise possible courses of action according to the risk level of each area analysed.

{156}------------------------------------------------

In particular, these activities are identified both according to their direct impacts, i.e. generated directly by the Company, and according to their indirect impacts, i.e. generated by third parties that collaborate with the Company. The analyses focus on one hand on Poste Italiane's own operations, with reference to the protection of the human rights of its employees and other stakeholders, and on the other hand, on the activities carried out by third parties connected to the Company, such as suppliers, sub-contractors, customers, local communities, and the financial community. Analyses are also carried out upon approval of new business relationships and corporate transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships.

Below are the various drivers that have been identified as most relevant to Poste Italiane's business. These drivers were considered in order to identify and analyse human rights risks, both direct and indirect, in relation to different material topics and financial and non-financial capital, as well as for the identification of specific mitigation actions.

## [6](#page-137-0).5 Managing climate change related risks and opportunities

Poste Italiane is aware of the relevance of the Company in terms of capillarity within the territory in which it operates. Therefore, the Group aims to reduce its environmental impact and contribute to the low-carbon transition of the country's economy.

Considering the relevance of identifying the potential economic impacts of climate change risks, the Group takes a responsible approach in conducting its activities.

This commitment is in line with the new edition of the "Global Risks Report" published by the World Economic Forum in January 2023. The paper tracks perceptions of global risks among industry experts and world leaders at various levels, examining them in five categories: economic, environmental, geopolitical, social and technological. The report reveals that the top three global risks to be addressed over the next decade are all environmental. To the side is the ranking of the "5 Top Global Risks" identified in the report.

{160}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane, in accordance with the main regulatory trends and in response to the growing requests from the financial community and the main stakeholders, reports information regarding climate change based on the areas defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, Metrics and Objectives. The TCFD, established in 2015 by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), published a set of recommendations to assist companies in reporting on the risks and opportunities that climate change may pose to corporate performance, in a transparent and comprehensive manner.

This section complements and supplements the information on the commitment, approach and initiatives to reduce environmental impact in the Pillar "Green transition".

## Governance

The organisational and governance structure reflects the Group's commitment to the proper management of environmental issues, and provides for specific roles and responsibilities.

- z The Board of Directors of Poste Italiane SpA approves the Sustainability guidelines and strategies on the basis of assessments that consider, among other things, the risks and opportunities related to climate change that may be relevant in terms of reputation for the Group.
- z The Sustainability Committee (CSost) is tasked with assisting the Board of Directors with investigative, propositional and advisory functions, in pursuing sustainable success. The Committee provides input during all assessments and decisions relating to environmental, social, and governance issues

{161}------------------------------------------------

La Specifically, the CSost carries out an activity specifically dedicated to climate change as part of its functions. In fact, the Committee examines, evaluates and makes proposals on the Group's environmental, social and governance (the latter with reference to Sustainability) strategy, including climate change strategies, annual targets and deliverables, considering potential projects related to these topics and monitoring their implementation over time. In addition, the CSost monitors climate-related risks and opportunities and all initiatives taken by the Company to address these issues, coordinating with the Control and Risk Committee and reporting to the Board of Directors. At managerial level, the main specific functions related to environmental topics are entrusted to the Chief Executive Officer and to the Group Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function. In fact, the CEO of Poste Italiane SpA has the task of establishing, maintaining and ensuring the effectiveness of the Internal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR), as well as formulating the Sustainability strategies connected to environmental issues and overseeing their implementation, continuously monitoring their adequacy and effectiveness, always considering the assessment of related risks and opportunities.

The Group Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function of Poste Italiane SpA, established within the Corporate Affairs function:

- z defines, in collaboration with the departments involved, the guidelines and objectives of Sustainability and corporate social responsibility for the Company, through the identification of a set of indicators for monitoring Sustainability performance, and the use of specific metrics used to monitor climate-related risks and opportunities, in line with best practices and related international guidelines;
- z constitutes, thanks to the contribution of the specialist units reporting directly to it ("direct controls"), as well as other risk controls ("indirect controls") present in Poste Italiane and the Group companies, the single point of reference for the governance and management of all risks.

Finally, with the aim of correctly identifying and managing climate-related risks and opportunities also for investment and insurance processes, additional controls were put in place. With regard to investment processes, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita have set up committees responsible for periodically analysing and assessing the ESG risk (including, therefore, also the environmental risk) of the portfolios and the evaluation criteria of the issuers' ESG profiles. As far as insurance processes are concerned, Poste Vita's Risk Office function is responsible for identifying, analysing and assessing the signs of change deriving from the various dimensions of the external environment, with particular attention to factors linked to climate change. The identification of these signals takes place jointly with the "Products Committee - ESG Assessments", which periodically examines and evaluates the criteria for defining the ESG profiles and the Group's product catalogue.

Poste Italiane considers several risk drivers, attributable to the two macro-areas transition risks and physical risks, to classify them in relation to climate change. After identifying and associating the risks with each driver, the Company went on to link the material and capital issues impacted, defining opportunities and potential negative impacts related to them, and identifying specific mitigation actions to be implemented. During the risk assessment process, Poste Italiane took into account both its own direct activities, as well as upstream and downstream operations, and finally included customers as the main beneficiaries of the Company's products. The Group has defined activities and actions for the business with respect to short (0-3 years), medium (3-5 years) and long term (5-10 years) perspectives, considering the time frame 2019-2030.

Poste Italiane supports the transition to a low-carbon economy through its commitment to reducing emissions in the business operations included in the Business Plan, consistent with achieving Carbon Neutrality by 2030, and in support of the Paris Agreement in limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

With regard to transition risks, considering the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) organisations and the main literature on the subject as a reference, the Group carried out a review of different scenarios to get a picture of potential future developments. In particular, Poste Italiane employed, after an evaluation of possible alternatives, two scenarios, IEA 450 and IEA B2DS, considered to be the most consistent with the timeframe envisaged for the assets and activities, and consequently the most suitable for the Group's business and objectives with respect to the alignment towards maintaining the global temperature at 1.5°C.

The IEA 450 scenario describes an energy pathway consistent with the goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to 2°C by limiting the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to around 450 parts per million of CO2 equivalent. By the year 2030, the scenario envisages the energy sector to be strongly characterised by renewable energies, with a marked improvement in vehicle and process efficiency, and a widespread replacement of coal by natural gas in power generation. With this in mind, starting in 2019, the Group has implemented a Renewal Plan that envisages the complete replacement of the entire vehicle fleet with new-generation, low-emission electric, hybrid and endothermic models, which will guarantee a reduction in energy consumption. In order to measure the value generated by fleet replacement, Poste Italiane adopted a specific investment valuation methodology that combines the traditional financial and non-financial perspectives, the so-called "True Value Bridge". This methodology is a useful tool to develop an integrated strategic planning to create shared value between the Company and the territory, identifying the net impacts generated by the green fleet compared to those that a traditional fleet would generate82.

{162}------------------------------------------------

The IEA B2DS scenario was taken into account, not least because of the relevance attributed to it by SBTi (Science Based Target Initiative) for setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. The focus is on the hypotheses for the development of climate policies and technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Poste Italiane has officially committed to setting science-based targets for its greenhouse gas emissions.

The scenario analysis conducted by the Company, in addition to considering the basic assumptions of the models, took into consideration the trends in the transport sector and the estimate of forecasts and development in the coming years. The Group then made projections of its business in order to identify related risks and opportunities. The scope of the analysis involved the logistics sector, thus including transport, buildings and facilities, key assets for the Company's business and for the Carbon Neutrality objective.

Following the various analysis activities, the transition risks identified by Poste Italiane are as follows:

#### Pillars impacted:

Green transition

Environmental impacts of logistics

#### Creating value for the country

Support for the socio-economic development of local communities

Innovation and digitalisation of products, services and processes

Quality and customer experience. CyberSecurity, IT Security and Privacy.

#### Capitals impacted:

- y Use of polluting vehicles that may have a negative impact on the environment and on Poste Italiane's reputation
- y Investments in innovative solutions that, nonetheless could have negative impacts on the environment, in terms of polluting emissions and energy consumption

#### Opportunities:

- y Leaner and more efficient management of operations
- y Reduce the Group's total energy consumption from non-renewable sources (e.g. fossil fuels)
- y Reduction of emissions related to the use of the vehicles that make up the company fleet
- y Cost reduction

### MAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS

Poste Italiane's support in the transition to a lowcarbon economy is driven by its commitment to set targets to reduce emissions and the environmental impact generated by its activities, achieving Carbon Neutrality targets by 2030. With this in mind, starting in 2019, the Group has implemented a Fleet Renewal Plan that envisages replacing the entire fleet of vehicles used for the delivery of postal products with green vehicles. The results of this policy are evident, as the Company has gone from 11% green vehicles in 2016 to 37% in 2022, more than doubling this percentage by 2021, with the aim of replacing the entire company fleet with low-emission vehicles by 2024, resulting in a CO2 reduction equal to that of around 80,000 trees.

This commitment is also strengthened in relation to the initiatives undertaken by the Group to support small Municipalities. In this regard, the Company aims to offer zero-emission services in 800 small Municipalities and 35 historical centres by 2024.

Poste Italiane has also expanded its range of services by entering the energy sector, with a 100% green product, produced exclusively in Italy from renewable sources and certified through guarantees of origin. This project allows the Group to correlate green transition issues with those of innovation and digitalisation, while representing a major opportunity for sustainable development at national level.

Finally, the new Polis Project envisages the implementation at Post Offices of interventions aimed at environmental sustainability and social growth of communities. In particular, it is planned to install 5,000 thousand charging stations for electric vehicles and 1,000 photovoltaic systems that will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions, 1,000 outdoor spaces equipped to host cultural, health and wellness initiatives, and 4,800 smart building systems and environmental monitoring sensors. In addition, by providing the possibility to access public administration services from a One-Stop Shop and through the creation of coworking spaces, the movement of citizens and the consequent congestion of roads and public offices will be reduced, allowing the reduction of CO2 emissions.

#### MAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND TOOLS

As part of the risk management model, the Group considers both the possible impacts that climate change-related phenomena may have on the business of Poste Italiane (indirect impact) and those that the Company's activities may have on the climate (direct impact). The process of identifying and assessing risks and environmental management methods also extends to counterparties (suppliers, business partners, other companies), impacting the procurement processes and any extraordinary finance transactions, providing, among other things, for the identification of suppliers and partners that may present risks related to environmental protection, also through a multi-dimensional analysis that takes into account parameters such as: possession of environmental, quality and energy performance certifications and adoption of environmental management systems, ethical standards of conduct and Minimum Environmental Criteria (MEC).

The correct identification and assessment of climaterelated risks and opportunities is also ensured by listening to stakeholders, who are periodically involved in the Multistakeholder Forums organised by Poste Italiane. They are also provided with a reporting system that allows them to bring any perceived risks to the attention of the Company.

In line with its decarbonisation strategy and in implementation of the guidelines for the exercise of voting rights and engagement activities and for investment in sensitive sectors, Poste Italiane, through its subsidiaries Poste Vita and BancoPosta Fondi SGR, has joined Climate Action 100+, an international collaborative engagement initiative to raise awareness of climate change issues among the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters.

Poste Italiane is focused on pursuing sustainable development by continuing to invest in projects aimed at strengthening ESG initiatives. In order to reduce the direct impacts that Poste Italiane's activities may have on the climate, the Company is constantly advancing the use of energy sources that do not use fossil fuels (e.g. solar energy from photovoltaic panels on buildings) and in the reduction of energy consumption (e.g. replacement of neon lamps and use of LEDs), also in order to cope with potential sudden changes in prices of energy among others, Poste Italiane, in line with adherence to the Paris Agreement and the New Green Deal, has set itself the ambitious goal of making its contribution to the achievement of international carbon neutrality targets by 2030, well in advance of the timeframe defined by the European Union.

{167}------------------------------------------------

With regard to the assessment of physical risks, Poste Italiane's Governance dedicated to risk and sustainability, in line with what the IPCC has developed worldwide on climate projections, has updated its climate and water risk assessment methodology to have a clear picture of the risk and assessment of potential physical risks and opportunities. In this sense, the Company has carried out a precise assessment, including in the analysis all the Group's production and sorting sites located in different areas of Italy.

Specifically, Poste Italiane, following an extensive analysis process that included the evaluation of the main Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) of greenhouse gases, and the consistency of these pathways with the duration of assets and activities, identified and selected two scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The Group selects RCP 2.6 as the reference scenario, in view of the ambitious nature of the risk mitigation activities envisaged in the Business Plan in relation to the landscape identified by the IPCC. RCP 2.6 scenario prefigures a peak in emissions at an early stage, with a subsequent decrease caused by the active removal of carbon dioxide within the atmosphere. RCP 2.6 is also known as RCP 3PD, in relation to the mid-century peak of ~3W/m², which will be followed by a major decline. With the goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2100, this scenario uses massive regulatory and policy intervention, leading to an almost immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The Company also considers the IPCC's "RCP 8.5" scenario, as it provides an example of the worst-case scenario, i.e. the condition of a continuous increase in emissions during the course of the 21st century. RCP 8.5 pathway results from insufficient emission reduction efforts and represents a failure to stem warming by 2100. Regarding the climate projections for the two scenarios, in fact, for RCP 8.5, areas of the Mediterranean will experience an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfalls, which will intensify in the second half of the century with an increasing trend until 2100. According to the RCP 2.6 scenario, on the other hand, there will be similar but smaller effects in the first half of the century, with a decreasing trend in the second half. This leads to a clear difference between the two scenarios in 2100.

Poste Italiane carried out a risk assessment with the aim of assessing the potential impacts of physical events related to climate change on the business. The risk assessment considered the extent of the risk already existing at the sites and the future risk up to the year 2024 (medium-term scenario), under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. In addition to the basic assumptions of the chosen models, the Company also conducted a further study on the data from the rainfalls and main temperature parameters of the different scenarios, then comparing them with current data with the aim of determining the significance of the variation with respect to the existing risk at the sites examined, in line with the RCP 2.6 scenario and taking into account the possible implications of the RCP 8.5 worst case scenario. Future projections of changes in physical risk levels related to natural disasters are relevant in strategic terms, although in most cases there is still no certainty. On the other hand, excessive reliance on what is already known from climate science must be avoided. Therefore, Poste Italiane's risk assessment is appropriate to the increasing level of risk in its business and operations.

The assessment of physical risks covers the entire revenue generated by the Group, amounting to €11.9bn of existing operations in 2022, mainly from Post Offices and hubs, which are potentially most impacted by extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, with a view to a long-term time horizon, in line with the Business Plan and the 2030 Carbon Neutrality target, all new operations are subject to risk assessments that also take into account physical climate risks.

The product result of the risk assessment is subsequently converted into potential days of business interruption and then multiplied by the value in terms of lost revenue (€) of one day of business interruption. The main risks that emerged from the scenario analysis are those related to extreme weather events and changes in rainfall patterns. The greater severity of extreme weather events such as rain, storms, snowfalls and possible floods or frosts, with consequent landslides and floods, could cause interruptions in production, sorting and therefore logistics activities, as well as damage to sites and higher logistics costs. The Group's financial performance, and thus its results and cash flows, are negatively impacted by the occurrence of such acute physical damage and the interruption of power distribution, resulting in a deterioration of reputation and loss of customer confidence. Examples are the floods in Genoa in 2016, 2019 and 2020, following which the Group collaborated with national and local institutions, as well as the more recent floods in Sicily in 2018, 2020 and 2021. These events led to damage to Poste Italiane's Post

Phenomenon of a similar nature occurred in Ischia in October 2022, where the Poste Italiane office was a point of reference for the population, a place where they could meet again with neighbours they had not heard from and gather initial information on what had happened on the rest of the island.

Precisely in consideration of a possible interruption of the activity, Poste Italiane carried out an analysis based on its production and sorting plants located in different areas of Italy. In this way, the Group was able to assess the potential financial impacts associated with climate events, compared to 2024. The sites with the highest potential financial impact due to flooding in 2024 are located in the regions of Northern Italy. In particular, the new hubs of Bologna and Landriano have been identified among the sites at greatest risk and which would lead to substantial loss of revenue in the event of business interruption, due to their operational importance. With regard to physical risks, the Group envisages specific mitigation measures in response to extreme weather conditions (e.g. landslides, avalanches, floods, etc.), which are detailed below.

With a view to continually improving the management of climate and environmental factors and their impact on the various prudential risks, in early 2023, BancoPosta Fondi, PostePay and LIS Pay, as non-banking financial intermediaries, aligned themselves with the Bank of Italy's recommendations regarding "Supervisory Expectations on Climate and Environmental Risks". The three institutions therefore started working on an action plan to integrate climate and environmental risks (physical and transitional) into their governance and control systems, business model and strategy, organisational system and operational processes, risk management system and market reporting.

## 6.6 Managing emerging risks and the related opportunities

[Summary](#page-3-0) [Section](#page-7-0)

#### MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

Poste Italiane deemed it necessary to include and manage emerging risks within its risk management processes, given their significance. Emerging risks considered are exogenous, disruptive events that can threaten the business model over a long-term horizon (up to 20 years) and are potential game changers for the industry and the context in which organisations operate. They are usually characterised by elements, such as:

- z uncertainty and visibility: lack of data useful to analyse the phenomenon and difficulty in finding skills, knowledge and awareness of the potential effects that they have on the business model;
- z timing of the changes: the changes derive from radical changes in the external reference context (social-environmental, legislative, technological, habits, etc.), which alter the processes from various points of view, in a destructive and unpredictable way over time;
- z management complexity: increasing complexity of management methods, related to the absence of immediate response actions to events resulting from highly interconnected exogenous factors with strong systemic dependencies and time accelerations.

Failure to adapt to these trends will result in missed business opportunities, reduced revenue, qualitative-quantitative repercussions in terms of the mix of its employees, and sanctions by regulatory and supervisory authorities. The tables below summarise the trends for each emerging risk arising from exogenous factors, the potential significant impact on the Company (based on SBUs information, risk categories, sustainability pillars and financial and non-financial capital potentially impacted, and on the basis of breaking down the main negative impacts and opportunities) and the main ways of managing them.

#### AGEING POPULATION:

Increased longevity combined with low birth rate resulting in a negative change in the generational distribution of customers for Poste Italiane

#### MAIN TRENDS POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR POSTE ITALIANE MAIN RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS

The process of ageing population is a phenomenon that is already clearly visible in the economies of the Eurozone and is destined to become more accentuated in the coming decades, with a reduction in the working-age population compared with the older population, which will instead tend to increase.

In Italy, in particular, there is a higher longevity in good health and a lower birth rate, together with a reduction in the number of women of childbearing age.

Ageing could also very significantly affect economic growth and have a negative impact on productivity. This aspect is also accentuated by the change in the balance between the active population and the retired population as well as by the irregular and low income capacity of younger people with consequent unfavourable effects on the social security system.

However, the rise in life expectancy and the increase in average age could support the emergence of new markets and new businesses.

#### *Trend: Increasing*

#### Risks impacted:

- y Operational
- y Financial and insurance

#### SBUs impacted:

- y Insurance Services
- y Mail, Parcels & Distribution
- y Payments and Mobile
- y Financial Services

#### Pillars and material topics impacted:

Protection of human rights; Equal career development opportunities.

*Continued*

#### Negative impacts:

- y Inadequacy of product offers (e.g., mobile phone price plans) and postal services (e.g., excessive digitisation of services) for changing consumer needs
- y Increase in insurance costs borne by the Group relating to care, assistance and welfare expenses for the elderly
- y Difficulty in developing reliable forecasting models that allow the Group to predict market developments

#### Opportunities:

- y Increased business opportunities due to changes in consumer needs, based on meeting the needs of the more mature population
- y Increased demand for life and P&C insurance products

Aware of the opportunities linked to the ageing of the population and considering the strong impact of demographic trends on its services, the Group has developed specific products for segments of the population with evolving needs such as, for example, the insurance product "Postaprotezione Infortuni Senior Più" specifically dedicated to people aged between 59 and 79. Each product offered by the Company is accompanied by clear and usable information to all types of customers in order to allow them to always make informed choices.

Poste Italiane launched the"Silver Economy" Programme designed for senior citizens, with the aim of managing all the Group's actions dedicated to this important segment of the population in a single synergistic framework. It is a package of financial and savings services, insurance, telephony, shipping and delivery, ideal solutions tailored to specific customers, making Poste Italiane a single point of contact able to meet different needs. The programme aims to help improve knowledge of financial and digital tools, through a training course led by Poste Italiane's financial and digital experts.

Poste Italiane promotes integrated strategies in favour of intergenerational dialogue and an exchange between generations within the Company, also on the basis of demographic forecasts and the relative impact on turnover. To this end, the Group promotes the crossfertilisation of different social, cultural and work experiences, as well as the different skills, knowledge and competences typical of each generation, encouraging discussion in a logic of complementarity and openness necessary to foster the exchange of experiences in support of inclusion and employment possibilities. In particular, as part of its actions in support of intergenerational exchange within the organisation, it promotes the "Generazioni connesse" (Connected Generations) survey, an initiative in continuity with the "FishBowl generation" project, which aims to focus on the languages, working styles and needs of the main generations present in the Company in order to identify and enhance shared actions capable of stimulating generational alliance.

#### Capitals impacted:

#### Negative impacts:

- y Possible economic repercussions from a global recession, resulting in a reduction in consumption of the products offered by Poste and difficulties in dealing with recovery
- y Adoption of new work models, which can create greater exposure to cyber attacks and fraudulent use of data
- y Difficulties in the timely management of new pandemics and inability to guarantee business continuity in the provision of its services
- y Amplification and acceleration of the effects of the main existing or emerging risks (e.g., disruption of the supply chains needed to carry out Poste Italiane's business activities and remote management of personnel)
- y Focusing attention on the development of the pandemic, with reputational impacts due to reduced commitment to ESG issues (e.g. reduction of environmental investments)

#### Opportunities:

- y Increased efficiency and productivity due to the adoption of remote working models and digital solutions to support the business
- y Acceleration of the transition to digitisation, with a consequent increase in demand for the digital products offered by Poste Italiane
- y Increased business opportunities due to changes in consumer needs, based on meeting the needs determined by the effects of the pandemic on the evolution of the socioeconomic context
- y Cost reduction (e.g. travel; property management)

#### MAIN TRENDS POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR POSTE ITALIANE MAIN RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS

The experience gained in the management of the health emergency resulting from the spread of Covid-19, has allowed the Group to develop operating methods that have significantly reduced the potential impact on business continuity (e.g. organisational measures to reshape operations for the branch network and logistics-postal activities; purchase of laptops and software to carry out activities in smart working mode; expansion and strengthening of tools for remote connection, managing travel). In particular, the Group has been actively involved in constantly monitoring the evolution of the virus, which has allowed proactive management of its effects, also in the long term, through investments in new technologies, in the security of IT infrastructures and in personnel training, making it possible to provide services in compliance with the security protocols necessary to combat the spread of Covid-19.

The controls implemented during the pandemic may represent useful resources for the management of any future emergency conditions.

In particular, the Covid-19 pandemic has fostered the implementation of business models based on an omnichannel strategy, forcing companies to adopt liquid and open operating models that combine technological innovation, data management at the service of the ecosystem, and digital and customeroriented operations to successfully cope with sudden changes in the market. In fact, the omnichannel strategy has transformed Poste Italiane into a platform company, resilient to the pandemic and the financial upheavals produced by the war in Ukraine.

With regard to the eventual management of new emergency measures and/or a new pandemic, the Group can leverage some specific strengths linked to the diversification of its activities, its multi-channel approach and the growth of its digital business, which ensure the service is also provided outside traditional Post Offices. The majority of the Group's overall revenue will not be linked to short-term commercial activities and the business model of BancoPosta is capital light, not assuming credit risk.

Moreover, the current pandemic has accelerated the Group's digitalisation path, which has, therefore, not only developed digital products and services, sustainable over time, in the postal, insurance, financial and payment areas, but has also introduced new ways of selling and communicating with customers, such as the introduction of the customer care service intermediated by artificial intelligence via voice (voicebot) and chat (chatbot and appbot), with the aim of promoting a radical cultural, organisational and technological change in the assistance model, relieving operators of the most repetitive tasks, allowing them to dedicate themselves to activities requiring human intervention and to the management of more complex and emerging situations.

While managing the health emergency, Poste Italiane focuses on pursuing sustainable development by continuing to invest in projects aimed at strengthening ESG initiatives, as highlighted in the Sustainability Strategy.

Digital transformation and technological advances have not only created a wide range of benefits for companies, but have also amplified the risks that need to be understood and managed. In particular, the development of technology is a process that generates impacts that move in a twofold direction: positive, for the innovations that allow to pursue more efficient and sustainable solutions; negative, for the consequences that robotics and data centers can have on the environment, in terms of polluting emissions and energy consumption.

Moreover, in view of the activities carried out by Poste Italiane, it is necessary to consider that the e-substitution is drawing a new market perimeter, produced by the exceedance of the digital market (electronic communications) and the Parcels segment (especially due to the spread of e-commerce), as well as changes in the habits and behavioural patterns of the population.

*Continued*

#### Negative impacts:

- y Inability to maintain attractiveness, due to the excessive digitisation of the products and services offered, towards part of Poste Italiane's traditional customers and/or potential target customers not reachable due to the digital divide
- y Inadequacy of standard products for changing consumer needs
- y Difficulty in responding in a timely manner to the digital drive in the sectors in which Poste Italiane operates
- y Interruption of digital services provided by Poste Italiane

#### Opportunities:

- y Development of technology products in line with different consumers needs
- y Development of new technologies to strengthen Poste Italiane's processes
- y Greater ability than competitors to understand customer needs, also with reference to targets in the "digital divide"
- y Increased demand for the products offered by Poste Italiane, thanks to customer confidence in its handling of privacy and sustainability issues

#### For Poste Italiane, innovation and digitalisation are two central drivers of strategic progress and enable it to guarantee its customers innovative technological solutions, also through the integration of its own products and services with those of third parties.

Poste Italiane has embarked on a digitalisation process that has influenced both its offer and business processes through the evolution of its omnichannel distribution model, which allows the Company to deliver services in an agile manner and in step with needs of customers.

Through a digitalisation of services, Poste Italiane intends to make integrated digital solutions available.

Communication channels with customers are also constantly evolving, which has led to the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions. These solutions have several positive impacts for both customers and the Company, as they allow for a 24-hour customer service 365 days a year, which contributes to bringing part of the population closer to and familiarising them with advanced technological systems.

Among the actions aimed at reducing the digital divide, in recent years, Poste Italiane has undertaken a path of digital education of citizens, carried out through the organisation of several training sessions with the aim of providing a valuable contribution to the digitisation of Italy and by expanding the dedicated section of the website with video clips, games, infographics, podcasts and a glossary.

Through the programme, the Group has adopted a highly inclusive approach in order to facilitate and simplify the use of new technologies to all its customers and beyond.

Poste Italiane set up the "Smart Letter Box" project to renovate classic letter boxes and equip them with IoT technologies and sensors. In addition to sensors for detecting mail, Poste Italiane's new Smart Letter Boxes have been equipped with sensors capable of detecting certain parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide In 2022, more than 400 Smart Letter Boxes were installed throughout Italy, including 300 in small municipalities.

| In the coming decades, a rise<br>in average temperatures of 3<br>degrees Celsius compared to<br>pre-industrial times could trigger<br>disastrous chain effects. The<br>combat against climate change,<br>therefore, is not an option but a<br>must. It is therefore necessary<br>to consider these aspects<br>when defining the strategies<br>and operational activities of<br>companies.<br>Trend: Increasing<br>Risks impacted:<br>y Reputational<br>y Operational<br>y Strategic<br>y Compliance<br>SBUs impacted:<br>y Mail, Parcels & Distribution<br>y Payments and Mobile<br>y Financial Services<br>y Insurance Services<br>Pillars and material topics<br>impacted:<br>Creating value<br>for the country<br>Dialogue and transparency with<br>the authorities;<br>Support for the socio<br>economic development of local<br>communities.<br>Green<br>transition<br>Environmental impacts of logistics<br>Environmental impacts of real<br>estate facilities.<br>Sustainable<br>finance<br>Integration of ESG factors into<br>investment policies<br>Integration of ESG factors into<br>insurance policies. | Negative impacts:<br>y Restrictions on Poste Italiane's business<br>operations due to extreme weather conditions<br>y Inadequacy of the products and services<br>offered with respect to the demands of<br>consumers increasingly driven by sustainability<br>issues<br>Opportunities:<br>y Increased business opportunities due<br>to changes in consumer needs (e.g.<br>development of low-emission services;<br>development of investment and insurance<br>products for climate adaptation)<br>y Possible access to new markets and new<br>customer segments requiring insurance<br>coverage<br>y Advantages deriving from the greater<br>reliability of the supply chain and Poste<br>Italiane's improved ability to operate in various<br>conditions compared to its competitors | Poste Italiane analyses, among others, the risks related<br>to climate change also in relation to the long term.<br>Specifically, the risk management model adopted by<br>the Group considers both the possible impacts that<br>climate change-related phenomena may have on the<br>business of Poste Italiane (indirect impact) and those<br>that Company's activities may have on climate (direct<br>impact).<br>The process of identifying and assessing risks and<br>environmental management methods also extends<br>to counterparties, impacting the procurement<br>processes and any extraordinary finance transactions,<br>providing, among other things, for the identification<br>of suppliers and partners that may present risks<br>related to environmental protection, also through a<br>multi-dimensional analysis that takes into account<br>parameters such as: possession of environmental,<br>quality and energy performance certifications and<br>adoption of environmental management systems,<br>ethical standards of conduct and Minimum<br>Environmental Criteria (MEC).<br>In order to classify climate-related risks and<br>opportunities, Poste Italiane takes different drivers<br>into consideration referring to two macro-areas<br>(transition and physical risks). In addition to defining<br>the associated opportunities, the Group provides for<br>specific mitigation measures to respond to the risks<br>identified and associated with each driver. Poste Italiane<br>defined a perimeter in the risk assessment process that<br>takes into consideration not only direct activities, but<br>also downstream and upstream operations, including<br>customers in the final analysis, given that they are the<br>main beneficiaries of Group products.<br>The correct identification and assessment of climate<br>related risks and opportunities is also ensured by<br>listening to stakeholders.

In order to provide new payment solutions and respond to the changing needs of its customers, Poste Italiane is developing new digital payment services, intercepting and driving customer habits in the context of digital transformation, through the creation of innovative products and services that simplify everyday life, such as:

- y Postepay Connect, first integrated payment and mobile product that allows managing, through a single app, telephony and payment services in an intuitive and secure way;
- y Postepay app, the e-wallet that allows paying for purchases directly with a smartphone in all stores that accept contactless payments, thanks to the recent introduction of the Google Pay service in the app;
- y Codice Postepay, an app that allows buying in stores using a QR Code and getting discounts and benefits at affiliated partners. . During the year, the user experience of the Code payment mode was evolved through the launch of "QR Code Web", the solution that allows the cardholder to frame the automatically generated QR code on the payment page, without additional clicks.
- y Collaboration agreements with start-ups for the development of innovative solutions in the financial services and payments area;
- y With a view to expanding its services, PostePay Spa has made available the possibility of making contactless payments also to customers with iPhones, Apple Watch, iPads and Macs via Apple Pay, giving them the option of adding their Postepay card, whether prepaid or debit card associated with their BancoPosta current account, to the Apple wallet.

MOBILITY REVOLUTION:

Need to review business models and delivery operations due to the introduction of new mobility models, technological evolution of vehicles, sharing mobility.

#### MAIN TRENDS POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR POSTE ITALIANE MAIN RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS

The transport sector is undergoing significant transformation,

driven primarily by technological innovations and the impact from digital on the habits, needs and preferences in terms of mobility of passengers and companies.

In addition, the shift towards more sustainable modes of transport, the control of polluting emissions, the environmental Sustainability of major works are issues that increasingly guide the preferences of citizens and the choices of transport operators.

Environmental impacts of logistics

#### Capitals impacted:

#### Negative impacts:

- y Restrictions on Poste Italiane's operations, with particular reference to deliveries, due to traffic restrictions (e.g. restrictions on polluting vehicles)
- y Limited availability of "green" vehicles suitable for carrying out Poste Italiane's logistics and delivery activities
- y Negative impacts on the environment and on Poste Italiane's reputation due to the use of polluting vehicles

#### Opportunities:

- y Reduce the Group's total energy consumption from non-renewable sources (e.g. fossil fuels)
- y Reduction of emissions related to the use of the vehicles that make up the company fleet
- y Leaner and more efficient management of operations
- y Cost reduction

Poste Italiane, aware that the vehicles used to carry out its logistics and delivery activities do not lend themselves to any type of optimisation, has been replacing them with equivalent electric-powered vehicles in recent years, improving its fleet in order to reduce atmospheric pollution. Among companies in the utility sector, Poste Italiane has one of the largest fleets of 100% electric commercial vehicles in the country.

During the year, Poste Italiane continued to implement sustainability initiatives, with particular reference to reducing the environmental impact of the corporate fleet, through the use of additional alternative fuel vehicles (electric, methane and LPG).

The Fleet Renewal Plan, which had already been activated in 2019 with the aim of replacing the entire fleet of vehicles used for the delivery of postal products with green vehicles, was continued in 2022 through measures to reduce energy consumption, lower atmospheric emissions, increase safety and increase load capacity for delivery. Poste Italiane demonstrated its commitment to pursuing the plan for the complete renewal of its vehicle fleet, increasing the green component of the fleet itself, through the introduction of electric and hybrid cars and motorbikes in line with ESG targets of a 40% reduction in emissions. The results of this policy are evident, as the Company has gone from 11% green vehicles in 2016 to 37% in 2022, more than doubling this percentage by 2021, with the aim of replacing the entire company fleet with low-emission vehicles by 2024, resulting in a CO2 reduction equal to that of around 80,000 trees.

In 2022, Poste Italiane completed the fleeting of about 2,000 electric cars and purchased 40 dualsocket columns for recharging electric vans, with further installation planned for 2023. The green fleet reached 37% of the total Poste Italiane fleet in 2022.

Over the next few years, as part of the objectives defined in the strategic plan, Poste Italiane aims to replace the entire vehicle fleet with 27,800 new-generation green vehicles with reduced environmental impact equipped with electric, hybrid, and endothermic propulsion, achieving a 40% reduction in polluting emissions.

As regards the purchase of logistics services, Poste Italiane maintains conduct consistent with sustainability issues, selecting and rewarding suppliers in line with the environmental, social and governance issues that the Poste Italiane Group promotes. In particular, the Company verifies the technical and professional suitability of its suppliers by requesting, for qualification purposes, the possession of specific requirements, including composition and type of vehicles in the fleet.

#### EVOLUTION OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR AS A FUNCTION OF THE MACRO-ECONOMIC SCENARIO AND CHANGES IN PURCHASING PREFERENCES:

Changes in consumer purchasing habits as a function of the macro-economic scenario as well as customer needs and expectations, requiring the ability to grasp these changes in a short timeframe and respond through operational and production adaptations, even profound ones.

#### MAIN TRENDS POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR POSTE ITALIANE MAIN RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS

#### Negative impacts:

- y Loss of customers due to Poste Italiane's failure to adapt its products/services to customer needs
	- y Difficulty in developing reliable forecasting models that allow the Group to predict market developments
	- y Reduction in purchasing power and change in consumers' investment choices that could have negative effects on Poste Italiane's margins and liquidity, as well as on the attractiveness of the products offered

#### Opportunities:

- y Adoption of new technologies to speed up and simplify access to Poste Italiane's products/services
- y Increased business opportunities due to changes in consumer needs, including through the adoption of strategies of increasing customisation of the offer
- y Greater ability than competitors to understand customers' needs
- y Development of socially and environmentally oriented products and services

Poste Italiane pays particular attention to the quality of the products and services offered with a view to constantly improving the satisfaction of its customers, and is committed to respecting the time and manner in which activities are carried out (service level and performance). In this sense, it guarantees the confidentiality of the data it holds, the protection of intellectual property and effective management system for IT security and cybersecurity.

The Company conducts dual-level monitoring, considering both the quality provided and the quality perceived. Specifically, there is a system of KPIs, based on individual business units, which constantly monitors the objectives and service performance provided, and provides management with improvements and trends in periodic reports. In order to initiate the "connection" between customer evaluations, operational performance and competitor results, Poste Italiane pursued the development of connected experiences with greater intensity. Through the evolution of the target setting methodology, Poste Italiane identifies the relevant components with respect to each macro area of the Group to be considered in the Customer experience measurements in order to cover all significant interactions with customers. Moreover, considering the increasingly integrated and central role of Poste Italiane's Partners in the definition and development of the various service components, a structured project was launched to listen to Partners and customers of third-party networks, in line with the Group's perceived quality model.

To simplify processes, streamline administrative workflows and improve submission times of administrative documents to Public Administration, Poste Italiane has developed a new service, "Poste in Pratica", aimed at Public Administration and citizens for submitting, checking, digitalising and sending administrative documents.

In addition, to improve the Customer experience and quality of the service provided, Poste Italiane uses listening methods to identify the most important actions to be implemented. Specifically, Poste Italiane analyses verbatim accounts – spontaneous feedback from customers regarding critical areas collected during the customer journey with the products and services offered, which are then translated into a Net Promoter Score, a measurement of satisfaction that asks customers whether they would recommend the Company's products or services to somebody else.

*Continued*

Purchasing logic and habits are continually changing and so too are consumers' needs and requirements: extending the range of product and service offerings to the market and making these immediately accessible thanks to technological innovation, requires companies to make a greater effort in securing customer loyalty and responding to their changing needs in terms of preferences and product experiences.

In addition, the current macroeconomic context - characterised by high instability, volatility and persistent inflation - affects consumers' purchasing power and investment choices (e.g. as a function of market rates).

In particular, we are witnessing a radical change whereby the moment of purchase is no longer limited solely to the evaluation, choice and eventual acquisition of a product or service on the basis of its characteristics and price, but is increasingly seen as a true experience, in which the consumer is personally involved. Furthermore, consumers are increasingly paying attention to social and environmental issues in their purchasing decisions and are willing to pay a premium for the sustainability of the products and services they buy.

In a constantly evolving scenario, permeated by mobile devices, social networking platforms, e-commerce and multichannel, it is necessary for companies to establish relationships of trust and complicity with their customers, in order to intercept any change in needs and behaviour of the latter.

The continuous listening process is guaranteed by the Customer Feedback Management service, which allows customers to be sent surveys relating to perceived quality, quickly making the answers obtained available to the competent structures and highlighting the most recurring issues highlighted by customers. In addition, the activities of the Quality and CX (Customer experience) Task Force continued, dedicated to analysing and listening to customer opinions in real time, with the aim of triggering rapid and selective action in respect of the evidence emerging from the continuous dialogue with customers and the front line. With specific reference to the commercial business channels, continuous front line listening was activated so that Large Accounts and SME/POE Accounts have an always active survey through which they can report areas of improvement related to sales activity and post-sales customer management.

Poste Italiane has equipped itself with a Web Opinion Monitoring (WOM) Service, through which it collects and analyses data from the desired sources of interest, such as social networks, App stores, reviews of Post Offices on Google Maps, public online information sources, blogs, forums, in order to generate real-time reporting on all topics of interest. The service responds to the needs of different member structures and consolidates in a single solution the services used by the various functions of Poste Italiane and Group companies. The areas for improvement that have emerged in relation to customer feedback constitute an important stimulus for process assessment and revision activities, together with the support activities functional to maintaining quality certifications and those identified by the "inter-functional communities".

Through the digital channel management area, which was activated in 2020 to enable continuous improvement of experience KPIs from both customer listening and external source analysis, more than 700 interventions have been carried out to date. These interventions positively affected the CES and rating app KPIs measured on the channels

GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY:

Possible negative impacts on Poste Italiane's business due to geopolitical tensions and international conflicts and related escalations.

| MAIN TRENDS | POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR POSTE ITALIANE | MAIN RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|

The geopolitical context, characterised by phenomena such as the return to protectionism, military conflicts, large-scale migrations, increased perception of social inequality and populism, is provoking extremist movements and potentially endangering international cooperation, which could lead - according to the most extreme scenarios - to military (also in light of the conflict in Ukraine) biological, chemical, cyber and/or physical attacks.

The current geopolitical context has had major impacts on the macro-economic context, putting pressure on global supply chains and commodity markets and fuelling inflationary dynamics on a global scale. In the major advanced economies, the slowdown in economic activity is attributable to weakening demand and the start of a cycle of tightening monetary policies adopted by the major central banks to counter rising inflationary pressures. .

## Poste Italiane continually monitors the political,

social and macro-economic context and regulatory aspects that could impact on its business, so as to identify and prioritise the response measures to be undertaken based on the different macro-economic scenarios and geopolitical projections.

In particular, as part of the Integrated Compliance process, Poste Italiane continuously monitors the external regulations relevant to the Group and translates all the regulatory principles into the body of rules necessary to guarantee their application, also with reference to legislation applicable to international trade relations.

In addition, Poste Italiane carries out checks on counterparties in order to assess their legal, technical and professional requirements, financial stability and identify variables with an impact on revenue and costs, also in consideration of geopolitical scenarios.

## 7.2 Impacts resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict

Following the recommendations issued by ESMA in the course of the year83, an update to 31 December 2022 of the main effects on the Group of the crisis in Ukraine is provided below; for a complete review, please also refer to the information provided in the section "Outlook" and in Chapter 3 "Materia events during the year" of the section "Poste Italiane's financial statements".

The macro-economic context during 2022 was characterised by a combination of factors leading to a widespread slowdown in economic growth. In particular, we highlight: the resumption of Covid-19 infections, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a growing inflationary dynamic, which has generated an increase in the prices of raw materials (especially energy), and interventions to normalise monetary policy by the world's main central banks, which have revised upwards their reference interest rates in order to stem the overheating of the economy. These factors interrupted the path of consolidation of the post-pandemic recovery that began in early 2022, with the global economy continuing to suffer from further increases in the inflation rate, negative developments in global financial markets and uncertainty related to the macro-economic scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022.

With reference to the impact of the ongoing conflict on business, it should be noted that the Group's sphere of operations is mainly domestic and it has limited business relations with the countries involved in the conflict; therefore, the Group has not experienced significant impacts on its business or significant repercussions on profitability, nor fears about the impairment of its ability to continue as a going concern.

Nonetheless, the high uncertainty of the reference context and the inflationary dynamics exacerbated by the conflict led to the following findings in 2022:

- z an increase in the cost of fuel and raw materials in general, and an increase in costs on all services related to international routes, including those outside the areas affected by the conflict; in this regard, actions have been implemented by the Government to mitigate the effects of these increases, such as, for example, the reduction of excise duties and VAT imposed by the State on fuel prices (extended until 31 December 2022), the social bonus electricity and gas and additional benefits for energy-intensive companies84;
- z consistent with the downsizing of the market in this sector, there was a slowdown in the growth of parcel volumes, particularly in B2C as a result of inflationary effects and thus a reduced purchasing capacity also in e-commerce. The parcel sector, especially in the first part of 2022, was also affected by the repeated lockdowns imposed in China (until November) to curb the spread of Covid-19;
- z in the financial sector, in the first half of 2022, postal savings were adversely affected by the socio-economic context characterised by a significant rise in interest rates, rising inflation, a decrease in households' propensity to save and a reduction in the country's growth prospects. With regard to the Postal Savings product offering, in light of the market context, yields on Postal Interest-bearing Certificates were adjusted three times over the course of 2022, and interventions were made in the range of products offered, including the launch of several offers dedicated to holders of new liquidity. In addition, following an analysis of BancoPosta's cost base, aimed at quantifying the impact of inflationary dynamics, a unilateral change was made to the contractual terms and conditions, related to the justified reason "inflation". With reference to the financial portfolio, it benefited from the changed market scenario with rising interest rates;
- z in the insurance sector, there is no significant evidence as indirect exposures, within the framework of multi-asset funds, to countries involved in the conflict represent an insignificant amount compared to the insurance group's investments (0.03% of the total);
- z the increase in gas and electricity prices and the considerable volatility of prices, also linked to the risk of reductions and interruptions in Russian gas supplies to Europe, did not have any significant repercussions for the Group's new energy business, whose offer was launched in June 2022 for a restricted target (employees, family members and pensioners) and from January 2023 for all customers. In its raw material procurement policies, the Group also selected suppliers with low or no exposure to gas from Russian territory.

Against this backdrop, the Group's performance during the period was solid and better than expected, with an operating result of €2.3 billion reaching a record level in the Group's history.

The Group's financial solidity and liquidity also made it possible to finance investments of more than €800 million in 2022, to pay shareholders €526 million as the balance of the 2021 dividend and €273 million as the interim dividend for 2022, and to accelerate the Group's growth through investments in strategic companies for business development, in execution of the shareholders' resolution of 27 May 2022, to finance buyback transactions totalling €25 million from its own funds (for the latter, see section 3 - Material events during the year - of the "Poste Italiane's financial statements" section).

### REVENUE

(€m)

Insurance Services Payments and Mobile Financial Services

{195}------------------------------------------------

Group revenue amounted to €11.9 billion, an increase of €669 million compared to 2021 (+6%) with the positive contribution of the Strategic Business Units Insurance Services (+€292 million or +15.7%), Payments and Mobile (+€265 million or +30%) and Financial Services (+€156 million or +3.3%). The Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit recorded revenue down by €44 million (-1.2%) compared to 2021. The contribution of the incremental revenue for the year 2022 realised by the newly acquired companies during the year (Plurima, LIS, Agile and Sourcesense) totalled €147 million.

The fourth quarter of 2022 shows revenue up by €369 million (+13.3%) compared to 2021 attributable to the positive performance of the Strategic Business Units Insurance Services (+€167 million; +40.5%), Financial Services (+€106 million; +9.7%) and Payments and Mobile (+€105 million; +40.2%) only partially mitigated by the negative performance of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit (-€10 million or - 1%). The revenue performance in the fourth quarter was reflected in an operating profit for the period of €237 million, an increase of €7 million (+2.9%) compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

#### TOTAL FINANCIAL ASSETS (€bn)

* Includes capitalisation of interest.

** Includes current accounts and assets under administration. Current accounts do not include REPO and Poste Italiane's liquidity.

*** Includes net inflows on: Investment Funds, Moneyfarm, Postal Savings Bonds, Insurance and Asset Management.

During 2022, total financial assets, which totalled €562 billion, decreased by 4.1% (-€24 billion) compared to the €586 billion at 31 December 2021, mainly due to the negative performance of the financial markets, which affected the fair market value of Poste Vita technical provisions (-€26.8 billion) and lower net inflows from postal savings (-€11.1 billion), only partially mitigated by positive net inflows in life insurance (+€7.6 billion) and current accounts

## Total financial assets €562 billion

(+€2.8 billion). Net postal savings inflows (-€11.1 billion) were affected by -€1.5 billion of lower pension accruals compared to 2021 (eleven accruals compared to twelve in 2021) due to the end of the health emergency provisions.

{196}------------------------------------------------

TOTAL COSTS (€m)

Total costs amounted to €9,598 million, up from €9,375 million in 2021 (+€223 million), mainly due to the increase in other costs (+€337 million), costs for goods and services (+€87 million) and depreciation and amortisation (+€39 million).

Personnel expenses amounted to €5,226 million, a decrease of €241 million compared to 2021. See the following section for more details.

Costs for goods and services increased by €87 million from €2,873 in 2021 to €2,960 in 2022; the change is mainly related to the expansion of the company perimeter (by €85 million) that took place during the year and to the international inflationary scenario (by €62 million) induced by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.

Depreciation and amortisation amounted to €830 million and recorded a positive change of €39 million compared to 2021 due to higher depreciation and lower impairment losses on property, plant and equipment and rights of use, mainly due to the expansion of the company perimeter, as well as higher amortisation on intangible assets related to investments in software applications.

Other costs amounted to €581 million and increased by €337 million compared to 2021; the change was mainly attributable to provisions for risks on tax credits (€320 million), which were partly offset by lower net allocations of the remaining items of other provisions for risks and charges.

Further information is provided in the Notes to Poste Italiane's Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

{197}------------------------------------------------

### PERSONNEL EXPENSES

#### (€m)

The total personnel expenses decreased by €241 million (-4.4%) compared to 2021. This change is mainly attributable to the reduction in the extraordinary component, which went from €232 million in 2021 to €70 million in 2022 (-€162 million). Ordinary personnel expenses decreased by €79 million from €5,236 million in 2021 to €5,157 million in 2022.

The change in the ordinary component compared to the previous year is mainly due to the reduction of the average number of employees during the year (about 1,600 FTE less).

The reduction in the extraordinary component was mainly due to the lower provision of the 2022 early retirement plan to support outgoing personnel in 2023 and 2024 in light of the residual availability of the early retirement provision due to the lower per capita cost of incentives recorded during the year and related to the benefits provided by the regulations ("quota 102").

{198}------------------------------------------------

#### NUMBER OF RESOURCES (average Full Time Equivalent in thousands)

The reorganisation and rationalisation of internal processes continued during the year; resources that left the Group in 2022, including early retirements subject to incentives, are 8.3 thousand (FTE) against new hires of 5.7 thousand (FTE) with permanent contracts and about 0.2 thousand (FTE) with fixed-term contracts. The enlargement of the Group's perimeter with the entry of Plurima, LIS, Agile and Sourcesense (+0.8 thousand average FTE) also contributed to the change in personnel for the period.

120,000

persons employed in 2022

Consolidated operating profit (EBIT) reached a record level for the Group at €2,291 million and increased by €446 million (+24.1%) compared to the previous year (€1,846 million), achieving the upwardly revised 2022 guidance communicated to the financial community in November.

The trend in the fourth quarter of 2022 is mainly influenced by the components recorded in operating costs as commented above.

{199}------------------------------------------------

#### EBIT BY STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNIT

(€m)

In 2022, the Group's operating profit amounted to €2,291 million, showing an increase of €446 million compared to the previous year. The growth in operating performance affected all Strategic Business Units with the exception of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit, which recorded an operating loss of €326 million in 2022, a decrease of €25 million compared to the previous year.

The operating profit of the Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit was positive by €1,350 million, an improvement (+€232 million) compared to the value achieved in 2021 (€1,119 million).

Performance is also growing for the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit and for Payments and Mobile, which recorded operating profit of €887 million in 2022 (+€141 million compared to 2021) and €379 million (+€98 million compared to 2021).

For more detailed information on the performance of the individual Strategic Business Units, please refer to the dedicated paragraphs later in the chapter.

{200}------------------------------------------------

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND TAXES (€m)

Profit for the period amounted to €1,511 million, a decrease of 4.3% compared to 2021 (€1,580 million), and took into account financial operations, which fell from €322 million in 2021 to €37 million in 2022; the 2021 balance benefited from the gross non-recurring capital gain of €225 million, recorded under financial income and recognised following the SIA-Nets-Nexi merger, commented on in the corporate actions section of the 2021 Annual Report. Taxes for the period increased by €229 million from €588 million in 2021 to €818 million.

Profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 amounted to €86 million, down by €319 million (-78.8%) compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year.

{201}------------------------------------------------

## 7.3.1 Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit

The 2022 performance of the Strategic Business Unit shows a decline in revenue in both the traditional mail business and the parcel business, despite the positive contribution of revenue from the acquisition of Plurima (€45 million in 2022). The operating result was adversely affected by higher provisions for risks, as discussed in more detail below, partially mitigated by lower personnel expenses.

#### EXTERNAL REVENUE (€m)

External revenue of the Strategic Business Unit went from €3,695 million in 2021 to €3,651 million in 2022 (-€44 million, equal to -1.2%), also confirming in the fourth quarter of 2022 the negative trend recorded in previous quarters.

Revenue from mail fell for the year (-€17 million, -0.8%), concentrated in the third quarter (-€14 million, -2.9%); similarly, revenue from parcels also fell (-€8 million, -0.5%), due to both the normalisation of market trends and the effects on the economy resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The decrease is partly mitigated by the positive contribution from the hospital logistics business conducted by the company Plurima acquired by the Group during the period (+€45 million).

In addition, there was a decrease in other revenue85 of approximately €19 million (-9.3% compared to 2021), mainly due to the lower contribution of revenue from Consorzio PosteMotori, whose activities are currently being concluded. This change was partially mitigated by the positive contribution related to the fee, applied from the end of 2021, for the activities of issuing digital identities to citizens (*[SPID](#page-486-0)* – Public Digital Identity System) for those who request the service through in-person or remote identification.

<sup>85.</sup> "Other revenue" includes revenue of the subsidiaries Consorzio PosteMotori (management of Ministry of Infrastructures and Transport paperwork, which ended on 31 March 2022), PatentiViaPoste (licence delivery service), Europa Gestioni Immobiliari (management of Poste Italiane's real estate assets), Poste Air Cargo (commercial air transport), Poste Welfare Servizi (management of Supplementary Health Funds), Sourcesense and Agile Power (companies operating in the IT sector). The item also includes revenue from the sale of philatelic products (e.g., folders, postcards, albums), from the activity of issuing digital identities to citizens (SPID - Public Digital Identity System), from the services of the platform dedicated to the booking of vaccines, revenue from the sale of tax credits, and finally other revenue not strictly related to Poste Italiane's core business (e.g., property rentals).

#### MAIL

REVENUE (€m) VOLUMES (m)

REVENUE (€m) VOLUMES (m)

4Q 2021 4Q 2022

4Q 2021 4Q 2022

Unrecorded Mail: standard mail service with mailbox delivery.

Recorded Mail: delivery to the person with proof of delivery and tracking for retail and business customers. This category includes in particular: registered mail, insured mail and judicial acts.

Direct Marketing: service for the sending by companies and Public Administration entities of communications with advertising, promotional or informative content.

Integrated Services: integrated and customised offers for specific customer segments, in particular Public Administration, large companies and professional firms. The most relevant integrated service is the Integrated Notification Service, for the management of the entire process of notification of administrative and judicial acts (e.g. violations of the Highway Code).

Other: services for publishers, multi-channel services, printing, document management, other basic services. This item also includes tariff subsidies relating to external revenue earned on products and services discounted in accordance with the law and the Universal Postal Service Compensation (also includes compensation relating to ordinary parcels).

{204}------------------------------------------------

The Group's performance in mail services in 2022 shows a drop in volumes of -4.7% (-119 million items), accompanied by a reduction in revenue of -0.8% (-€17 million) compared to 2021. Despite the different product mix throughout the year, the growth in volumes of some higher-value products in the Integrated Services and Recorded Mail (Judicial Documents) family does not fully offset the decline in lower-value products.

Unrecorded Mail showed a reduction in both volumes and revenue of 10.2% (-131 million items) and 9.9% (-€61 million) respectively compared to 2021, attributable to a physiological drop in volumes due to the e-substitution.

Recorded Mail recorded a 3.5% drop in volumes (-6 million items) accompanied by a 1.6% drop in revenue (-€12 million) mainly attributable to both a drop in volumes sent by retail customers and a decrease in volumes from foreign countries.

Direct Marketing continued to show a decrease in volumes of 15.8% (-48 million items), resulting in a negative change in revenue of approximately €11 million (-13.2%), which is also attributable to the e-substitution phenomenon.

On the other hand, Integrated Services showed an increase in volumes and revenue compared to 2021 of 23 million items (+125.9%) and €73 million (+58.6%) respectively, due to the positive contribution generated by the resumption of service activities for products such as administrative and judicial documents and the resumption of the dispatch of tax collection notices which, in 2021, had been affected by the continuing effects of the blocking of service dispatch due to the pandemic.

The item "Other", which also includes services marketed by Postel, shows an increase in volumes in 2022 compared to 2021 (+43 million items, i.e. +5.5%), accompanied, however, by a decrease in revenue of €6 million (-1.1%). This development is mainly attributable to the growth in volumes marketed by Postel, which handles lower average rate products. "Other" also includes the Universal Service compensation (€262 million), unchanged with respect to 2021, and compensation for subsidised publishing products included in the Universal Service, which increased by €1 million (+2%) compared to the previous year, as a result of AGCom Resolution 454/22/CONS, which defined a gradual increase in universal tariffs for publishing services as of 1 September 2022. For further details, please refer to the "Regulatory context and evolution of the regulatory scenario" of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit.

The decrease in the business segment of traditional mail compared to both financial year 2021 and Q4 2021 is mainly attributable to the secular trend of decreasing volumes of unrecorded mail related to e-substitution.

{205}------------------------------------------------

#### PARCELS

B2B: acronym for Business to Business. Company to company shipping services. Offer that focuses on quality and reliability, with delivery options with defined delivery times, mainly multi parcel shipments.

B2C: acronym for Business to Consumer. A modular offer created for e-commerce with a choice of additional services.

C2X: identifies Consumer-to-Consumer/Business parcels i.e. parcels sent by consumers both to other consumers and to businesses.

OTHER: includes revenue and international shipments and from partnerships with logistics operators. The item also includes revenue from dedicated services (highly customised services designed to meet the specific needs of Banks, Insurance Companies, Public Administrations or customers with the same technical-operating characteristics), from integrated logistics services (warehouse management) also including the consideration for the contract awarded by the Ministry of the Interior for the distribution of personal protective equipment. Finally, it includes revenue from long-haul road transport, a service operated by the subsidiary sennder Italia, and revenue from hospital logistics, a service performed by the company Plurima.

{206}------------------------------------------------

In 2022, the parcels sector recorded an overall decline both in terms of volumes and revenue, respectively by 3.6% (-9 million items) and 0.5% (-€8 million) compared to the previous year. However, during the course of the year, the decrease recorded in the initial part, generated by an uncertain market, gradually eased with a continuously improving trend; in particular, in the last quarter of the year, revenue and volumes grew respectively by 5.0% (+€19 million) and 4.2% (+3 million items) compared to the same quarter of 2021. The drop in revenue in 2022 is partially offset by the entry into the hospital logistics business through the acquisition of Plurima (+€45 million).

The year's decline was mainly concentrated in the B2B segment, which generated revenue of €224 million, down 14.2% (-€37 million), against 36 million shipments (-€6 million, -13.3%) compared to 2021.

This business segment, which is significantly linked to GDP growth, was strongly affected by international geopolitical tensions, which put industrial production in crisis during the year, due to price increases especially in the energy sector.

The B2C segment showed positive performance mainly concentrated in the second half of the year. In particular, in this segment, the third quarter of 2022 bucked the trend of the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter confirming sharper growth (+6 million items, +11.5%). In this regard, we highlight the substantial increase in shipments directly related to e-commerce during the Christmas peak and a recovery of inbound flows from China, which had slowed down due to the entry into force of the low value consignment regulations in July 202186.

The C2X segment showed revenue and volumes down by €8 million (-13.4%) and one million items (-16.4%) respectively compared to 2021, mainly as a result of a marked market contraction.

The item Other, shows an increase in revenue of €6 million (+1.7%), accompanied, however, by a reduction in volumes of 3 million items (-15.6%) compared to 2021. This positive performance is attributable to the positive contribution of the company Plurima, in spite of the foreseeable negative effect related to the reduction in business volume on integrated logistics87 services serving the public administration.

There was a further delay in the international business both in revenue (-€9 million, or -10.2%) and in volumes (-1 million items, -24.6%) where a progressive slowdown in demand was observed throughout the year.

<sup>86.</sup> The European Low Value Consignment Directive introduced the obligation for final customers to pay VAT also on the purchase of low-value goods.

<sup>87.</sup> Poste Italiane was awarded the integrated logistics contract in May 2020 for the delivery of personal protective equipment to public administrations.

{207}------------------------------------------------

TOTAL COSTS

Costs including depreciation, amortisation and impairments for 2022 amount to €8,838 million, an increase of €146 million (+1.7%) compared to 2021. This trend is mainly attributable to the increase in Other costs partially mitigated by the reduction in personnel expenses.

Personnel expenses amounted to €5,114 million, down €252 million (-4.7%) compared to 2021, attributable to both lower provisions for future early retirement incentives (-€157 million) and a reduction in the average workforce (approximately 1,800 FTEs less than in the same period of 2021), despite the expansion of the company perimeter, which involved the entry of people from Plurima, Agile and Sourcesense into the SBU.

Costs for goods and services show an increase of €21 million (+0.9%), reaching €2,371 million in 2022. This change is concentrated in the last quarter of the year (+€37 million, +5.8%) and is attributable both to the increase in variable costs related to the growth in parcel volumes in the period, and to the international inflationary scenario, which characterised 2022 and is still ongoing.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairments increased by €34 million (+4.5% compared to 2021), mainly due to higher depreciation and lower reversals on Property, plant and equipment and to amortization of intangible assets related to investments in software applications that became available for use during the year.

In 2022, other costs mainly included provisions for risks on tax credits (€320 million), which was partly offset by lower net allocations of the remaining items of other provisions for risks and charges due to both updated estimated liabilities and the disappearance of liabilities identified in the past. For further details, please refer to the notes in the "Poste Italiane's Financial Statements" section.

In light of the above, the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit posted an operating loss for the year 2022 of €326 million, a decrease compared to the operating loss for the same period of the previous year, which amounted to €301 million (-€25 million).

## Quality of the Universal Postal Service

The quality results achieved for the Universal Service, whose objectives are defined by AGCom, are shown below. The regulator verifies compliance with the objectives and publishes the results annually.

The quality trend for the financial year 2022 shows good performance overall, with almost all products exceeding their targets for the year. In comparison with the previous year, the trend was heavily impacted by the fourth wave of Covid-19 contagions, which affected the first quarter of 2022 and led to a sharp increase in the absenteeism rate across all operational structures of the logistics chain, including the segments contracted out to third parties.

## 7.3.2 Financial Services Strategic Business Unit

The SBU's operating profit for the period increased compared to 2021, mainly due to the net interest income accrued on the use of retail and government account deposits. The Total Capital Ratio at 31 December 2022 stood at 23.1%, confirming BancoPosta's solidity.

{210}------------------------------------------------

#### EXTERNAL REVENUE AND REVENUE FROM OTHER SECTORS (€m)

Pro-active portfolio management: gains from the sale of securities in the BancoPosta Portfolio, net of losses.

Net interest income: income from investment of liquidity revenue via postal current account deposits, net of interest expense and other financial transaction costs. Including profits from tax credits.

Postal savings deposits: savings deposits through Postal Interest-bearing Certificates and Postal Savings Books issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.

Asset management: collective asset management through mutual investment funds and management of individual portfolios relating to institutional mandates attributable to the Group.

Distribution of third-party products: distribution of products disbursed/issued by third-party partners (financing, mortgages, loans, salary-backed loans, credit cards, etc.).

Collection and payment services: slips, collections and payments PP.AA., transfer of funds and ancillary services for current accounts.

{211}------------------------------------------------

External revenue in 2022 amounted to €4,939 million and recorded an increase of €156 million compared to the €4,783 million achieved in the previous year (+3.3%).

In detail, the period under review shows: (i) Net interest income up compared to 2021 (+€425 million; +28.6%), essentially due to the higher yield from the use of current account balances relating to the Public Administration (+€218 million) and the use in tax credits (+€215 million); (ii) Net capital gains realised as part of the pro-active portfolio management of €335 million, down €72 million compared to €407 million in 2021.

Revenue from the postal savings deposits and management service amounted to €1,600 million, down 8.7% (-€153 million) on the previous year, reflecting the changed macro-economic context that accelerated early redemptions of Postal Interestbearing Certificates, dampening net deposits from postal savings, despite the adjustment of the offer and yields in the second half of the year; the remuneration provided for in the agreement with CDP was set at the minimum level (floor) in 2022. Revenue from collection and payment services amounted to €763 million, down 4.2% (-€33 million) compared to 2021, mainly due to lower volumes on slips and as a result of the transfer of the Debit Card business unit of the Payments and Mobile SBU to PostePay in October 2021; this negative change was only partially offset by higher current account maintenance costs (+€58 million) incurred by holders following the repricing in July 2022. Revenue from the distribution of third-party products amounted to €213 million, down by €8 million compared to the €221 million of 2021, mainly attributable to lower revenue from personal loans.

Revenue from other sectors amounted to €820 million (+8.1% compared to 2021). The positive change is mainly attributable to the increase in *[management fees](#page-484-0)*  of insurance policies and the growth in revenue from the placement of products of the Payments and Mobile SBU.

The fourth quarter of 2022 showed external revenue up by €106 million (+9.7%) compared to the same period of 2021, mainly due to higher net interest income (+€153 million), partly offset by lower revenue from the postal savings deposits and management service (-€41 million, -9.3%).

In 2022, the average balance of current accounts increased compared to the previous year, going from €79.1 billion to €86.5 billion. This increase of €7.5 billion is attributable to growth in all business segments and specifically to the positive contribution of the Public Administration (+€4.9 billion, +52.4%) and Retail and Postepay customers (+€2.3 billion, +4.6%).

Portfolio *[duration](#page-483-0)*  5.4 5.0

The average balance of the investment portfolio consists primarily of Italian government securities and debt securities issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and guaranteed by the Italian State (over €64 billion), in which funding from private customers on postal current accounts is invested, and deposits with the MEF (over €14 billion) represented by funding from postal current accounts belonging to public customers.

The investment portfolio also includes the average balance used by BancoPosta to purchase tax credits, which amounted to approximately €7.3 billion at 31 December 2022.

In the course of 2022, the upward movements in interest rates and the widening of the credit spread of the BTP were opportunities for the Group to purchase securities.

(data in bps)

{213}------------------------------------------------

At the same time, the generalised rise in interest rates led to an increase in the market value of the interest rate swaps entered into to hedge the fair value of the securities portfolio, which transform the yield of the latter from fixed to variable. In February and May 2022, early extinguishment transactions were carried out on part of this derivatives portfolio (amounting to a notional value of approximately €7 billion). The transaction as a whole, did not have any significant immediate impact on the statement of profit or loss, but made it possible to consolidate a fixed return in line with the Group's medium-term return objectives, while at the same time improving the profitability profile of a portion of the securities portfolio for subsequent years.

In addition, in the first part of the year, the following were entered into: (i) management hedging transactions of the yield on the deposit with the MEF of funding from the Public Administration, with the aim of making it less susceptible to changes in the yields of government bonds;(ii) forward sale contracts with value date 2023 in order to start the capital gains realisation programme within the framework of the pro-active management of the portfolio for the year 2023.

In the third quarter of 2022, considering the rise in rates and the narrowing spread, transactions were carried out to sell securities hedged with asset swaps and related derivatives, and transactions to purchase domestic government bonds with a 10-year maturity.

During the second half of 2022, against a backdrop of widening Italian credit spreads and rising Eurozone government bond yields, forward purchases of securities were made in order to start the programme of early renewal of investments maturing in 2023.

#### POSTAL SAVINGS NET INFLOWS (€m)

At 31 December 2022, Postal Savings Net Inflows amounted to approximately -€11.1 billion, approximately €5.8 billion less than in 2021. This negative change affected both products in the segment. A contraction of around €3.9 billion was recorded on savings books compared to the 2021 figure, due in part to the lower propensity to save linked to the particular national and international economic context, inflationary pressures and the recovery of consumer spending. In addition, net inflows for the year were affected by outflows from institutional customers related to the general economic scenario (-€1.7 billion). Finally, the comparison with the previous year is not homogeneous: in fact, twelve pension accruals were credited in 2021 as a result of the health emergency-related provisions, compared to eleven in 2022 (the March 2022 pension accrual, credited at the end of February, was the last accrual paid in advance), resulting in lower net inflows of €1.5 billion.

With regard to Postal Interest-bearing Certificates, the change compared to the 2021 figure is negative by about €1.9 billion; this change was due to early redemptions of €33.6 billion (+109% compared to 2021) and redemptions of certificates that matured during the year (albeit 23% lower than in 2021), which occurred mainly in the first half of 2022 and was partly mitigated by new annual subscriptions of €43 billion, up 42% compared to the 2021 figure, which regained momentum following the adjustment of yields on the products included in the offering that began on 6 July 2022.

{214}------------------------------------------------

* Interest is calculated at the beginning of the year in respect of interest accrued in the previous year. Average value of deposits excluding both the capitalisation of interest for the period and interest accrued, but not yet due, on Interest-bearing Postal Certificates that have not expired at the reporting date.

The Postal Savings Average Deposit recorded a decrease of around €2.6 billion compared to the 2021 figure; the value of savings books is related to the lower preference for liquidity and the shift towards investment products, while the growth in the Average Deposit of Postal Interest-bearing Certificates (BFP) is mainly attributable to the capitalisation of interest.

#### TOTAL COSTS (€m)

* The item includes costs for goods and services, adjustments/reversals, depreciation/amortisation and other costs and expenses.

{215}------------------------------------------------

Total costs of the Strategic Business Unit amounted to €4,872 million and increased by €76 million (+1.6%) compared to the €4,796 million realised in 2021, mainly due to higher costs to other segments (+€123 million) mainly related to higher costs to sales networks against higher volumes of activities. This change is partially mitigated by higher releases of provisions for risks mainly due to the prescription of certain balances relating to BancoPosta's fund transfer business and the adjustment of the estimate of certain risks related to the distribution of postal savings products and litigation with third parties.

The operating profit (EBIT) of the sector in 2022 amounted to €887 million, up 18.9% compared to 2021 (+€141 million).

Financial management for the year was negative by €22 million (positive by €10 million in 2021) and takes into account the impairment adjustment of €21 million on the value of the Anima investment. For further details, please refer to the notes to the statement of financial position in the Group's consolidated financial statements.

After taking into account taxes for the period (€243 million), the net profit of the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit in 2022 amounted to €622 million, an increase of €66 million compared to €556 million in 2021 (+12%).

LEVERAGE RATIO

At 31 December 2022, the Leverage Ratio stood at 2.9%, slightly down from 31 December 2021 as a result of the elimination of the benefit of the sterilisation of BancoPosta's Cash and Deposit with the Bank of Italy (Reg. (EU) 2020/873) in the calculation of the adjustments charged to the assets reported in the denominator of the ratio formula. This correction was applied until the first quarter of 2022 due to the health emergency88. The CET 1 Ratio at 31 December 2022 stood at 20.3%, while the Total Capital Ratio including Additional Tier 1 was 23.1%, confirming BancoPosta's capital solidity.

#### EXTERNAL REVENUE

(€m)

* Includes Poste Insurance Broker and other revenues.

Life revenue: placement commissions on the sale of Class I, III and V policies; management commissions on Class I and III policies; protection margins on the sale of protection products (Credit Protection Insurance policies (CPI), Temporanea Caso Morte (TMC) and Long Term Care (LTC)) policies and changes in other technical provisions on life policies.

P&C revenue: revenue from retail (Modular and Payments) and group (Welfare) protection policies, as well as for the sale of motor policies and other revenue.

External revenue went from €1,861 million in 2021 to €2,153 million in 2022 (+15.7%) and are essentially attributable to the Life business, which contributed €2,002 million, while the contribution of the P&C business totalled to €151 million.

Specifically, Life net revenue increased by 15% (+€262 million) compared to the same period of 2021, mainly due to: i) the positive contribution of the financial margin (which rose from €1,455 million in 2021 to €1.670 million in the same period of 2022, an increase of €215 million); the latter benefited from the growth in average assets under management (higher average total provisions of €9 billion, of which €6.5 billion in Class I and €2.5 billion in Class III compared to 2021) and higher profitability thanks to the increasing returns of the Separately Managed Accounts89; ii) the contribution from the positive change in Other technical provisions (+€50.5 million), in particular attributable to the positive contribution of the expense reserve.

The returns achieved by the Separately Managed Accounts during the year (2.68% for PostaPensione management and 2.59% for PostaValorePiù management) were positively impacted, for an amount of €1,088 million, by the increase in the inflation rate with reference to the so-called *["Inflation Linked"](#page-483-0)*  securities held in Poste Vita's portfolio (with a nominal value of around €8.9 billion at 31 December 2022). This income, realised by the Company, was largely recognised to policyholders through the revaluation of the commitments towards them represented in the value of the technical provisions.

P&C net revenue amounted to €151 million, up €30 million compared to the same period in 2021, +25.1%). In particular, gross premiums written increased by €67 million (+21.5%) compared to 2021, while charges for claims increased by €37 million (+22%) related to the new guarantees in the modular offer and the growth of the Welfare business. The Combined Ratio, net of reinsurance, was 87.7%, down compared to the corresponding period of 2021 (91.1%).

The fourth quarter showed an increase in Life net revenue of €155 million (+39.9%) compared to the same period of the previous year, attributable to the performance of the financial margin (+€77 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021), due to higher revenue related to inflation-linked securities and the positive contribution from the change in other technical provisions and other

technical income/expenses (+€59 million), mainly attributable to the positive contribution from the expense reserve.

In the P&C segment, there was an increase in revenue (+€12 million) compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly due to the growth in *[earned premiums](#page-485-0)* (+€15 million) only partially mitigated by the increase in claims expenses (+€6 million).

{219}------------------------------------------------

Life business gross inflows amounted to €17.2 billion, down 2.2% (-€0.4 billion) compared to the 2021 financial year due to the decrease in inflows from Multi-class products, which fell by €2.6 billion during the year, but still accounted for a significant proportion of total gross inflows (44%). This was partially offset by the increase in inflows from traditional build-up products, which grew by €2.2 billion during the period.

Gross premiums written in the P&C business amounted to €375 million, an increase of €67 million (+21.5%) compared to 2021 (€309 million) driven by all segments: (i) the "Modular Protection"90 line +19.2%; (ii) payment protection policies +11.2%; and (iii) the "Welfare" segment, whose premiums rose from €119 million recognised at the end of 2021 to €152 million in 2022, mainly supported by new distribution agreements signed with corporate customers (Employee Benefits).

#### LIFE NET INFLOWS AT 31 DECEMBER 2022 (€m)

Life net inflows amounted to €7.6 billion (€8.1 billion at the end of 2021), down mainly as a result of the trend in gross inflows, and remained positive on the Separately Managed Accounts and Internal Funds portfolios91. The *[lapse rate](#page-485-0)* of 3.5% was up from the same period last year (3.0%), but still much lower than the average market figure of 6.71% at 31 December 202292.

Life business net technical provisions amounted to €139.6 billion and decreased by €19.2 billion compared to 31 December 2021, mainly due to the decrease in *[Deffered Policyholder Liabilities](#page-483-0)* (-€27.2 billion) as a result of financial trends during the period affected by developments in interest rates and the spread BTP-BUND. This change was only partially offset by the increase in mathematical provisions (+€8 billion) due to positive net inflows.

#### CHANGES IN NET TECHNICAL PROVISIONS FOR LIFE BUSINESS (€m)

#### BREAKDOWN OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO (€m)

In 2022, in line with the latest *[asset allocation](#page-482-0)*  approved by the Company, the portfolio diversification process continued, with the aim of reducing the concentration of Italian risk, in favour of *[asset classes](#page-482-0)* that have a lower correlation to the risk associated with Italian government bonds93, such as non-Italian government bonds94.

Within investment funds, diversification has been evident with a reduction in the concentration of risk associated with government

<sup>93.</sup> Included within the Italy Govies asset class is the Company's financial liquidity (cash awaiting transfer to the different asset class managers). At 31 December 2022, financial liquidity as a percentage of the entire portfolio was approximately 1.07%. The value of the investment portfolio at 31 December 2022 differs from the value of the life technical provisions depicted in the graph above. The difference is due to the different valuation of the individual items ("cost" principle in the presentation of the investment portfolio, IFRS ("market value") principle in the presentation of provisions), as well as to a different scope of reference; in particular, the value of the investment portfolio does not include the value of class D investments (Class III) and also considers the balance of free assets.

<sup>94.</sup> Government securities issued by states other than Italy, as these are shown as a separate item.

securities.

#### TOTAL COSTS (€m)

Total costs at 31 December 2022 amounted to €805 million, an increase of €60 million compared to 31 December 2021, mainly due to higher costs to other segments as a result of: i) higher commissions paid to the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit (+€55 million); in detail higher maintenance commissions paid during the year (+€49 million) as a result of the growth in average assets under management, only partially offset by lower commissions paid for distribution and collection activities as a result of the decrease in gross inflows relating to the Life segment (-€4 million); higher commissions paid on the P&C segment (+€7 million); higher management commissions paid to BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR (+€3 million); ii) higher costs in respect of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit (+€8 million), mainly related to call centre activities (+€2 million), back office, IT service fees and Poste Welfare Services for the management of settlements (a total of +€6 million).

In light of the results illustrated, the economic performance of the Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit shows EBIT of €1,350 million in 2022, up by 20.7% (+€232 million) compared to 2021 (€1,119 million).

Taking into account financial management (positive by €41 million), which includes €22 million incurred for the mass lapse hedging treaty, and taxes for the period (€413 million), the Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit achieved a net profit of €979 million at 31 December 2022, up 18.8% (+€155 million) compared to 2021.

{223}------------------------------------------------

#### SOLVENCY RATIO PERFORMANCE

The Poste Vita Group's *[Solvency Ratio](#page-486-0)* stood at 253%95 at 31 December 2022, down on the 261% reported at December 2021 (-7 p.p.), and remains well above the regulatory requirements and management's expectations (200%).

The change in the period is due to an increase in available own funds (+24 p.p.) as a result of the dynamics of the interest rate trend (+290 bps 10-year swap rate) and the BTP-Swap spread (+64 bps 10-year spread), which on the one hand cause an increase in Own Funds, due to the decrease in technical provisions partially offset by the reduction in the market value of investments, and on the other hand, an increase in the capital requirement.

The increase in the Capital Requirement (-35 p.p.) is mainly due to higher underwriting risks and specifically the *["lapse risk"](#page-485-0)* . The latter is calculated, as per the standard formula96, by assuming a 40% lapse scenario for policies. In an economic context of rising interest rates, such as that experienced during the year, the value of policies became more profitable. It follows that with the increase in interest rates, the "mass lapse " scenario envisaged by the aforementioned formula becomes more valuable (i.e. increases the valuation of the related risk), even though the level of actual lapse s has remained substantially stable. The increase in lapse risk was not offset by the reduction in other risks, mainly represented by the lower market risk due to the conditions of the economic scenario of the period.

On 29 July 2022, the Parent Company increased Poste Vita's capital endowment by subscribing to a capital instrument, subordinated for €500 million, under terms and conditions that allow it to be counted as core capital ("Restricted Tier 1" or "RT1"). This capital strengthening is aimed at optimising the company's capital structure and supporting the future growth and development of the Poste Vita Group's business.

The Company also signed a treaty to hedge the mass early lapse risk, referring to Class I and Multi-class products, which allows for an increase in the 2022 Solvency Ratio (+30 p.p.). Against the current backdrop of economic uncertainty, the current outlook for the Italian insurance market suggests that early policy termination behaviour by customers may show increasing trends in the future, although this phenomenon is not evident in the Company's portfolio to date.

<sup>95.</sup> The *[Transitional Measures](#page-486-0)* , which set the Solvency Ratio at 31 December 2021 at 285%, cannot be adopted at 31 December 2022 because the value of the technical provisions calculated under Solvency II is lower than the value of the statutory technical provisions. The indicator takes into account the dividends expected in favour of the Parent Company for the year 2022. The value of the Solvency Ratio is currently undergoing the annual review process and will be communicated to IVASS by 19 May 2023.

The SBU's performance in 2022 was up on 2021, with positive contributions from all segments (electronic money, collections and payments, and telecommunications). The Energy segment, which started in June 2022 on a narrow target customer base, also performed well in the 2022 financial year.

#### EXTERNAL REVENUE

(€m)

Electronic money: prepaid cards (top-ups, payments, withdrawals, fees, issuance), debit cards (Postepay debit – interchange fee on card transactions; from October 2021, also withdrawals, P2P top-ups and fees to customers); acquiring services (transaction fee, fees and services) related to the supply of POS (mobile, physical, virtual) for accepting card payments (debit, credit, prepaid). Phone top-ups for all mobile network operators (MNOs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), commercial services for tobacconists/HORECAs.

Collections and payments: tax payment service through acceptance of the F23 and F24 models; funds transfer for sending money abroad via Moneygram and Western Union, post giro transfers and direct debit made by Postepay Evolution, payments on the PagoPA system, MAV, payment collection, revenue stamps, acceptance of postal pay slips and other direct LIS payments.

TLC: mobile phones (revenue from traffic, and the sale of mobile phones and routers from PO corners) and fixed line (PosteMobile Casa and PosteCasa Ultraveloce offers).

Energy: revenue from electricity and gas sales following the start of the employee and family promo in mid-June 2022 and revenue from optimising the energy management portfolio.

External revenue in 2022 amounted to €1,147 million, marking an increase of €265 million compared to December 2021 (+30%) thanks to the positive contribution of all sectors. In particular, the Collections and Payments business strengthened its performance following the acquisition in September 2022 of LIS Holding SpA, which brings incremental revenue of €93 million to the SBU's revenue in 2022 (distributed between the Electronic Money and Collections and Payments segments), while the Energy business benefited from the launch of electricity and gas sales services in June 2022 to a restricted target of employees, family members and pensioners of the Group.

In detail, revenue in the Electronic Money segment grew by €124 million, from €457 million in 2021 to €582 million in 2022, due to higher revenue from payment card operations, also attributable to the contribution from Poste Italiane to PostePay of the debit card business unit on 1 October 2021 and the aforementioned acquisition of LIS Holding SpA in September 2022, as well as higher revenue from acquiring services.

{226}------------------------------------------------

Revenue from Collections and Payments services grew by €118 million (+102.7%), rising from €115 million in 2021 to €233 million in 2022, driven by PagoPA payment advices and instant transfers97 from Postepay Evolution.

The Telecommunications segment recorded growth of €10 million, compared to the €309 million revenue achieved in 2021 (+3.2%). The increase is attributable to higher revenue from the fibre optic connectivity service.

In June 2022, the new energy offer was launched for employees, pensioners and family members of the Poste Italiane Group, which, at 31 December 2022, recorded €12 million in revenue, of which, €7 million from the sale of energy services and €5 million from energy wholesale management activities. The energy offer launched in June recorded around 47 thousand subscriptions in 2022 (of which 29 thousand for commodity power and 18 thousand for gas) against a customer base of 38 thousand active contracts (of which 23 thousand for power and 15 thousand for gas).

The performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 confirms the sustained growth in the Collections and Payments and Electronic Money segments. In particular, the high transaction volumes of payment cards related to the increase in transactions on both physical and digital channels and the acquisition of LIS Holding, drove the revenue of the Electronic Money segment to €178 million in the fourth quarter (+30.6% compared to fourth quarter 2021). In the fourth quarter of 2022, Collection and Payment Services recorded revenue of €99 million (+104.5% compared to the same period of 2021), mainly due to the positive contribution of the PagoPA payments service to the Public Administration. Positive performance also for the Telecommunications segment, which posted revenue of €82 million in the final quarter of the year (+€4 million, +5.4% compared to fourth quarter 2021) supported by growth in the customer base of the fibre service, and for the Energy segment, which posted revenue of €9 million.

#### CARD STOCK (m)

At 31 December 2022, the total stock of prepaid and Postepay Debit cards amounted to 28.9 million, with total transactions98 equal to €71.4 billion, up by approximately €10.3 billion (+16.9%) compared to 31 December 2021.

In 2022, there was an increase in payment card transactions of 16.2% (+327

In the area of acquiring, against a number of POS installed at 31 December 2022 of about 280 thousand, a transacted volume of €27.1 billion was developed (+18.3% of transacted volume compared to 2021, an increase of €4.2 billion).

At 31 December 2022, the percentage of slips accepted on third-party networks and digital channels was slightly down compared to December 2021, while the prevalence of alternative channels to the post office for PostePay top-ups was confirmed.

STOCK SIM (figures in thousands)

In Telecommunications, the customer base related to mobile services, at 31 December 2022, is represented by approximately 4.5 million lines, substantially in line compared to 31 December 2021.

With reference to Fixed Telephony services, the "PosteMobile Casa" offer and the "PosteCasa Ultraveloce" fibre optic data connectivity offer recorded a 19% increase in lines, rising from 298 thousand lines at 31 December 2021 to 356 thousand lines in December 2022. In detail, the lines of the 'PosteMobile Casa' offer decreased by 4.8% compared to December 2021, rising from 270 thousand lines in 2021 to 257 thousand in December 2022, while the lines of the "PosteCasa Ultrafast" offer reached 99 thousand units in December 2022, an increase of 70 thousand lines compared to December 2021.

TOTAL COSTS

The total costs of the Strategic Business Unit amounted to €1,031 million, an increase of 12.1% (+€111 million) compared to the €920 million incurred in 2021.

The increase in the cost of goods and services is mainly attributable to higher variable costs related to the operation of cards in the Electronic Money business, as well as to the expansion of the scope of operations generated by the acquisition of LIS. There was also an increase in costs in the Energy segment following the launch of the commercial offer during the year. These increases are partly mitigated by lower costs from telephone traffic in telecommunications, following the change of network operator *[(Mobile Host Operator – MHO)](#page-484-0)* in 2021.

The increase in costs to other segments (+€23 million) compared to 2021 is mainly determined by higher outsourcing costs to the Parent Company, with particular reference to the distribution activities of payment services, as well as higher outsourcing costs recorded in connection with the Energy segment's information systems.

Personnel expenses increased by €9 million compared to December 2021, due to the expansion of the workforce following the acquisition of LIS and the new Energy business.

In light of the results described, the economic performance of the Payments and Mobile Strategic Business Unit in 2022 shows an operating profit (EBIT) of €379 million, up by 34.8% compared to the previous year (€282 million).

Financial management showed a negative change of €228 million compared to the previous year, which was mainly attributable to the non-recurring income of €225 million from the merger of Nexi, Nets and SIA in 2021.

For further information, please refer to the section "Principal corporate actions" in the 2021 Annual Report.

Profit for the year amounted to €270 million, down 36.6% from the 2021 figure of €425 million. Net of the aforementioned corporate actions in 2021, the change in net profit would be a positive +€64 million compared to 2021 (+30.8%).

{231}------------------------------------------------

During 2022, the Group continued the evolution of digital channels with a view to ensuring a seamless, omnichannel experience for its customers based on the following main drivers of evolution:

#### Introduction of new features on digital channels

- z New payment methods have been developed in the BancoPosta app, such as payment with a Postepay code, sending money via P2P102, and the Google Pay service, with which it is possible to make payments directly from smartphones with the Android operating system in enabled physical and on-line shops.
- z It will be possible to view the receipts of credit transfers, postage payments and payment of slips from the app and from the website poste.it directly on the notice board or by sharing the contents via e-mail, as well as to display on the notice board receipts of payments made at post offices for credit transfers, postage payments and top-ups.
- z The digital assistant *[(BOT)](#page-482-0)* service was evolved in order to monitor the status of shipments.
- z As part of the evolution of the fibre offer, new services were made available in the app (e.g. the possibility of defining the method of payment and receipt of invoices), as well as the possibility of managing the new PosteCasa Ultraveloce Start offer in the self-service area (app and web) with the possible integration of the voice option.

#### Strengthening the catalogue of offers on digital channels

- z The possibility of subscribing to the Fibra offer has also been enabled in the BancoPosta app and the Postepay app, and sales from the contact centre have been activated.
- z The launch of the remote financial offer was completed at all post offices, with the possibility of sending the advisory proposal to the customer's private area and the possibility of finalising it via digital funnel.
- z In September 2022, the Postepay app integrated the functionality of sales of electricity and gas products for employees of the Poste Italiane group. The sale is fully omnichannel: customers can start the purchase process and conclude it later also via another channel; there is also full and autonomous supply management from the web channel and the Postepay app.
- z During the third quarter of 2022, the cross-selling initiative (integrated sales) of the Fibre service with the Poste Vivere Protetti policy103 was launched in the post office network and in the digital channel.

#### Optimising PosteBusiness infrastructure

During the year, the new version of the PosteBusiness app was made available, including new functionalities for customers (configuration of the Business Window, management of collections via mobile POS and the use of the Postepay Evolution Business card).

<sup>102.</sup> Peer to peer is a technology that allows the interchange of money: two different devices (computers, tablets or mobile phones) are able to communicate with each other for the transfer of a sum of money, without the details of the current accounts or credit cards of both being displayed.

<sup>103.</sup> The initiative is aimed at offering customers who request the PosteCasa Ultraveloce service a discount for subscribing to the PosteVivere Protetti range of modules for damage coverage and home assistance. To promote the insurance solution, a dedicated banner is provided at the end of the on-line purchase funnel of the Fibre service, through which the customer will be able to directly access the calculation of the policy quote and proceed to its subscription directly from the digital channel.

		- y Agile Group and Sourcesense (€18 million and €30 million)
		- y Scalapay (€25 million)

Below is the evolution of the Group's allocated capital compared to 2021 and its distribution among the SBUs.

#### (€bn)

* Other includes the purchase of treasury shares, the coupon on the hybrid bond, the granting of put options for the purchase of minority interests and the change in the IFRS 2 reserve.

Allocated capital at 31 December 2022 amounted to €11.03 billion, an increase of €0.74 billion compared to 31 December 2021, mainly due to the 2022 profit for the year of €1.51 billion, partially offset by dividends for the year of €0.84 billion (partly distributed through an interim dividend of €273 million in November). The Group's allocated capital is mainly attributed to the Insurance Services (57%) and Financial Services (26%) SBUs.

In the area of reducing environmental impacts, work continued on replacing traditional lamps with LED technology (more than 32,000 in 2022) automation and remote control of facility management (more than 960 buildings involved in the Smart Building project in 2022) in order to reduce electricity consumption and CO2 emissions. Over 120 photovoltaic systems were also installed during the year.

In 2022, work continued on the routine management of security in the workplace, in particular with the distribution of security equipment at territorial

branches and IT security through activities to prevent threats and counter cyber attacks; Poste Italiane's video surveillance service was further extended to sites that were not yet served and existing systems were improved, gradually replacing obsolete digital video recorders (DVRs) and burglar alarm control units; in particular, more than 200 new cameras were installed during the year, replacing 500, and more than 500 burglar alarm control units were replaced.

Within the scope of Technological Transformation and Engineering, the migration of existing digital services to the new infrastructure based on Hybrid Cloud continued, through a *['containerisation' procedure](#page-482-0)* of application components. In addition, Data Center consolidation activities continued during the year, which saw the closure of the Rozzano (MI) site.

In the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit, total investments amounted to €60 million and mainly related to the expansion of the Postal Savings, Life and Funds product range with a multi-channel perspective and the improvement of the customer experience.

With regard to the Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit, design activities continued in 2022 to support industrial development and the continuous functional/infrastructural improvement of the most important business support systems, as well as the interventions to adapt the systems to comply with regulatory obligations. Total investments in the year amounted to €26 million.

Investments for the period of the Strategic Business Unit Payments and Mobile amounted to €97 million and concerned developments to support the fixed and mobile network offer with the aim of increasing its competitiveness on the market, as well as IT investments for the Bollettino and PagoPA areas and those aimed at supporting the launch of the electricity and gas offer on the domestic market.

For further details on initiatives aimed at accelerating the digitalisation processes [and om](#page-231-0)nichannel use of the offers of the various Strategic Business Units, see the section on "Strengthening of digital channels".

Net working capital at 31 December 2022 amounted to €1,396 million and decreased by €889 million compared to the end of 2021. The following contributed to this change:

- z lower trade receivables of €329 million and higher trade payables of €205 million;
- z decrease in other receivables and assets net of other liabilities of approximately €355 million (mainly due to the change in tax items related to the operations of the Insurance Services and Financial Services Strategic Business Units).

The reduction of working capital by €889 million ensured a lower financial requirement and an internal source of financing, allowing liquidity to be freed up.

With regard to trade receivables, the focus in 2022 was on monitoring late payment situations and improving overdue credit recovery activities. Specifically, the prevailing activities focused on systematically sending reminders, reducing the time for blocking the service for customers in arrears, and speeding up the dispatch of irrecoverable files to the legal department.

During the year, the Group continued its efforts to set up direct channels with customers in arrears in order to understand their reasons and take action to make the collection process more effective. These activities ensured significant improvements in the reduction of collection times for both past and current receivables.

With specific reference to receivables from the Public Administration, there was a significant reduction in receivables from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti due to the new invoicing and collection schedules set forth in the current Convention.

On the other hand, the increase in trade payables is mainly attributable to changes in the group's perimeter due to the corporate transactions of the year, the inflation increase and the increase in investments.

The balance of Sundry provisions and Other assets/liabilities at 31 December 2022 amounted to €716 million and decreased by €1,182 million compared to 31 December 2021 mainly due to higher net deferred tax assets of €1,053 million (largely due to the negative changes in the fair value of financial instruments classified in the FVOCI category) and the reduction in employee severance indemnities for €217 million, partially offset by the increase in provisions for risks and charges for €88 million (mainly 

{237}------------------------------------------------

due to the provision for tax credits Law No. 77/2020, net of the decrease in the provision for leaving incentives).

Equity at 31 December 2022 amounts to €8,937 million, a decrease of €3,173 million compared to 31 December 2021. This change was mainly attributable to the positive effect of the profit for the period of €1,511 million, which was more than offset by the distribution of dividends in the amount of €801 million105 and the decrease in the fair value reserve resulting mainly from the negative change in the fair value of financial instruments classified in the FVTOCI category in the amount of €3,865 million.

#### GROUP NET DEBT/(FUNDS) (€m)

105. The value includes approximately €3 million in dividends distributed to minority shareholders by subsidiaries.

{238}------------------------------------------------

Total net debt/(funds) at 31 December 2022 showed funds of €2,406 million, down €4,752 million from 31 December 2021 (surplus of €7,158 million). The following mainly contributed to this change:

- z a positive operating result of €2,387 million (of which €1,511 million related to profit for the year, €830 million to depreciation and amortisation, and €47 million to other residual items);
- z the positive effect of the change in working capital and taxes amounting to approximately €1,089 million of which:
	- decrease in gross trade receivables of about €360 million (excluding the contribution from corporate transactions);
	- €91 million of higher trade payables (excluding the contribution from corporate transactions);
	- a decrease in Other Receivables and Assets net of Other Liabilities of about €330 million mainly attributable to the net decrease in tax-related items mainly related to the operations of the Insurance Services and Financial Services Strategic Business Units;
	- change in taxes for about €307 million;
- z investments in assets for €810 million;
- z the negative effect from the distribution of dividends in the amount of €801 million (of which €273 million related to the interim ordinary dividend planned for the financial year 2022);
- z investments in shareholdings amounting to €843 million, of which €526 million related to the acquisition of the LIS group (of which €700 million related to the disbursement), €248 million related to the Plurima group (of which €105 million related to the disbursement), €39 million related to the Sourcesense group (of which €30 million related to the disbursement), €27 million related to the Agile group (of which €18 million related to the disbursement) and €3 million related to the investment in Eurizon Capital Real Asset;
- z the negative valuation effects for the period amounting to €5,353 million, mainly attributable to negative fluctuations in the value of investments classified in the FVTOCI category, held mainly by the Financial Services Strategic Business Units, and residually by the other SBUs;

{239}------------------------------------------------

- z other decreases totalling €422 million, mainly attributable to the increase of €381 million in financial liabilities for leases falling under IFRS 16.
With regard to financial instruments held by the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit, the overall fair value fluctuation during the year was negative by approximately €15.5 billion and was recognised in a specific equity reserve for negative €4.4 billion for the portion not hedged by fair value hedges, and through profit or loss for negative €11.1 billion for the portion hedged, offset by the positive fair value change of fair value hedging derivatives.

At 31 December 2022, the total balance of derivatives in fair value hedge was positive for €5.4 billion (negative for €4.4 billion at 31 December 2021). In addition, as part of these hedging transactions, following the positive change in derivative instruments, the Parent Company recorded an overall net change in Guarantee Deposits of about €9 billion (as at 31 December 2022, the balance of Guarantee Deposits was a debit balance of €4.8 billion, while at 31 December 2021, the balance was a credit balance of €4.2 billion).

Total revenues generated by Poste Italiane SpA in 2022 amounted to €10,053 million, up 3.7% year-on-year (€9,691 million in 2021). Revenues and Income increased by €419 million (+4.9%) compared to 2021, due to the contribution of revenues from financial services, which showed an increase compared to 2021 mainly attributable to higher income from the use of postal current account deposits and free cash balances, partly mitigated by the decrease in income from postal savings deposits, due to the contraction in deposits affected by the macroeconomic context during the year.

The decrease in Other income from financial activities, compared to the previous year, is mainly due to lower realised gains from financial instruments. The increase in Other operating income is mainly due to higher dividends distributed by subsidiaries during the year.

Total costs, net of Depreciation, Amortisation and Write-downs, increased from €8,091 million in 2021 to €8,233 million in 2022, mainly due to the increase in other operating costs (+€390 million compared to 2021) partially offset by the decrease in personnel expenses (-€248 million compared to 2021). The increase in other operating expenses was mainly attributable to: i) higher provisions for risks and losses on tax credits, only partially offset by lower net provisions for other provisions for risks and charges; ii) the increase in financial operating expenses mainly due to the effect of higher interest expenses recognised to public customers for deposits on postal current accounts, following the upward shift in the interest rate curve, partially offset by lower losses from the realisation of financial instruments.

{244}------------------------------------------------

The item Depreciation, amortisation and impairments increased by €29 million compared to the previous year due to higher depreciation and lower write-downs on both property, plant and equipment (€20 million) and rights of use (€4 million) mainly due to the expansion of the leased fleet, as well as higher amortisation on intangible assets (€5 million) related to investments in software applications that became available for use during the year.

The total personnel expenses decreased by €248 million (-4.7%) compared to 2021. This change is mainly attributable to the decrease in the extraordinary component and partly to the decrease in the ordinary component.

The decrease in the extraordinary component is mainly due to lower exit incentives (-€156 million).

The change in the ordinary component compared to the previous year is mainly due to the reduction of the average workforce (about 1,500 FTE less than in 2021).

Income tax expense is up from €100 million for 2021 to €253 million in 2022, an increase of €153 million. The 2022 balance includes the positive effect of €6 million relating to the tax benefit associated with the Aid to Economic Growth (ACE), referred to the 2013 financial year, for which, in the year under review, the uncertainties associated with quantification no longer exist.

Poste Italiane SpA's net profit for the year ended 31 December 2022 was €847 million (€797 million in 2021).

Poste Italiane SpA's net invested capital amounted to €7,187 million at 31 December 2022 (€5,095 million at 31 December 2021).

Non-current assets amounted to €7,895 million, an increase of €1,382 million compared to 2021. Investments in tangible and intangible assets of €751 million also contributed to the formation of non-current assets, partly offset by amortisation, depreciation and impairments of €538 million. Right-of-use assets recorded a positive change of €95 million, which mainly took into account acquisitions during the year for new contracts and renewals of existing contracts in the amount of €291 million (mainly related to the rental of company vehicles for mail and parcel delivery activities), positive adjustments of €37 million for contractual changes during the year, and depreciation and amortisation for the period of €208 million. The value of equity investments increased by €1,078 million compared to 31 December 2021 mainly attributable to the effect: i) of the subscription, on 9 September 2022, of PostePay SpA's paid capital increase totalling €700 million aimed at providing the company with the financial resources needed to complete the acquisition of LIS Holding SpA, which was finalised on 14 September 2022; ii) of the recapitalisation, on 3 August 2022, of Poste Vita SpA through the subscription of a subordinated, non-convertible capital instrument, with perpetual duration and a non-call period of 10 years, totalling €500 million, aimed at strengthening its Solvency Ratio; iii) of the purchase on 24 February 2022 from Poste Vita SpA of 100% of the share capital of Poste Welfare Servizi S.r.l for a total of €70 million; iv) of the capital contribution, on 14 April 2022, to Poste Welfare Servizi S.r.l for a total of €55 million aimed at providing the company with the financial resources necessary for the acquisition of the company Plurima SpA; v) of the adhesion, on 28 October 2022, by Poste Italiane SpA to the voluntary public tender offer for the shares and warrants issued by the company Sourcesense SpA with a total investment of €30 million; vi) of the acquisition, on 13 October 2022, of a 70% shareholding in the company Agile Power S.r.l and indirectly of the entire Agile Lab Group, for a total of €18 million, which provided for the payment by Poste Italiane in favour of the founding shareholders, who will retain the remaining 30%, of €13 million and the subscription of a paid capital increase in favour of the companies of €5 million; vii) of the merger by incorporation into Poste Italiane SpA of the subsidiary PSIA S.r.l, effective as of 1 November 2022, which generated a merger surplus totalling €330 million, recognised in the specific equity reserve. In addition, on 29 September 2022, the Information Technology business unit of BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR was transferred to Poste Italiane SpA with effect from 1 October 2022.

Net working capital at 31 December 2022 amounted to €3 million and decreased by €644 million compared to the end of 2021, mainly due to the combined effect: i) of the decrease in trade receivables mainly attributable to the decrease in receivables due from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (-€365 million) due to the new billing and payment methods on a monthly basis and no longer on a quarterly basis, introduced by the Agreement of 23 December 2021, effective from 1 January 2022; ii) of the increase in deferred income mainly due to the non-repayable contribution (€125 million) received in advance from Poste Italiane SpA for the realisation of the "Polis - Casa dei servizi digitali" project; iii) of the increase in the total liability that Poste Italiane SpA has towards its subsidiaries in its capacity as tax consolidator (+€113 million).

The balance of Provisions for risks and charges amounted to €1,257 million (€1,169 million at the end of December 2021) and mainly includes provisions for early retirement incentives of €352 million (€515 million at 31 December 2021); this reflects the estimate of liabilities that the Company committed to irrevocably incur, under the current arrangements agreed with the unions, as a result of a certain number of personnel taking voluntary early retirement by 31 December 2024.

The balance also includes the provision of €320 million for risks on tax credits under Law 77/2020.

Provisions for disputes with third parties regard the present value of expected liabilities deriving from different types of legal and out-of-court disputes with suppliers and third parties, the related legal expenses, and penalties and indemnities payable to customers. At 31 December 2022, the provision amounts to €265 million (€265 million at 31 December 2021). Movements during the year primarily regard updated estimates of liabilities and uses to cover liabilities settled.

Provisions for operational risks relating to liabilities arising from transactions conducted within BancoPosta and amounting to €109 million at 31 December 2022 decreased compared with the balance at 31 December 2021 (€134 million). The net absorptions for the year, totalling €12 million, mainly reflect the prescription of certain stocks related to the funds transfer business and the adjustment of estimates of risks related to the distribution of postal savings products as well as fraud.

The Provision for personnel expenses amounts to €101 million (€120 million at the end of December 2021) to cover expected liabilities arising in relation to the cost of labour, which are certain or likely to occur but whose estimated amount is subject to change. They have increased (€89 million) to reflect the estimated value of new liabilities and decreased as a result of past contingent liabilities that failed to materialise (€33 million) and settled disputes (€75 million).

The net balance of Deferred Tax Receivables (Payables) as at 31 December 2022 was positive in the amount of €1,223 million (insignificant balance as at 31 December 2021); the change in the period was largely attributable to the net positive tax effect on the net negative change in the fair value reserve of investments in available-for-sale securities.

Equity amounted to €3,808 million and decreased by €3,227 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to the movement in the fair value reserve(-€3,326 million), which essentially reflects the fluctuations (positive and/or negative) from the valuation of investments classified in the FVTOCI category, as well as the payment of the 2021 balance and the 2022 interim dividend to shareholders (-€799 million) and the change in the cash flow hedge reserve (-€93 million). These changes are partially mitigated by the €847 million profit for the year.

## 7.7.3 Report on operations of BancoPosta RFC

## Corporate Governance at BancoPosta RFC

With regard to BancoPosta RFC's governance, the rules governing the organisation, management and control of BancoPosta's operations are contained in the specific BancoPosta RFC Regulation approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting of 14 April 2011 and recently amended by the Extraordinary General Meeting of 29 May 2018. As a result of the issuance by the Bank of Italy on 27 May 2014 of an update to the Prudential Supervisory Provisions for Banks, the provisions for banks on the organisational and governance structure, the accounting and control system and the capital adequacy and risk containment institutions apply to BancoPosta RFC.

Further information regarding the corporate governance structure is provided in Poste Italiane's "Report on Corporate Governance and the Ownership Structure", approved from time to time by the Board of Directors and published in the "Governance" section of the Company's website.

BancoPosta also has an "Organisational and Operational Regulation" approved by the Board of Directors of Poste Italiane, the latest update of which dates back to 24 June 2022. These regulations describe BancoPosta's operating model, its organisational structure and the related responsibilities assigned to the various functions, as well as the processes for assigning BancoPosta's business functions to Poste Italiane and for outsourcing BancoPosta RFC.

The process of "Governance of Assignments and Outsourcing" of BancoPosta RFC, already subject to review in 2018, was further strengthened, lastly in June 2022, with reference to the scope of the activities assigned and/or outsourced, with a view to improving the quality of processes.

During the second quarter of 2022, preparatory activities were started for the renewal of the Specifications106 expiring in December 2022. In accordance with the deadlines set out in the regulations, the Disciplinary Rules for Essential or Important Functions (EIFs) and Control Functions updated for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025 were sent to the Bank of Italy on 28 October for the relevant checks (so-called "Prior Notice"). On 2 January 2023, the Authority replied, finding no obstacles to the assignments in question: BancoPosta is therefore proceeding with the signing of the Disciplinary Measures, having included certain changes envisaged in the so-called "Plan of Interventions" drawn up in relation to the observations received from the Supervisory Authority as a result of the inspection carried out in 2022.

In 2022, with the aim of overseeing and strengthening the methods of dialogue on the assigned and outsourced functions, the Operational Committees with the functions of Poste Italiane (Private Market, Digital, Technology & Operations, Information Security, Fund Movement, Corporate Market and Public Administration) continued, and committees for the areas of Business Continuity Management (BCM), CERT, Fraud Management and Human Resources and Organisation were started. Operating Committees also continued with BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR, which provides the service of financial management of BancoPosta RFC, and with PostePay SpA, which manages various products on behalf of BancoPosta, such as, for example, utility bills, car tax stamps, RAV, credit transfers, direct debits, money orders, euro transfers, passbook cards and the payment platform.

During the first half of 2022, a contract to manage individual investment portfolios on behalf of third parties was signed with BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR. The integration of the envisaged contents, concerning the migration period and handover, the specification of the place of service delivery, termination rights, the discipline of sub-outsourcing and business continuity, is effective as of 1 January 2022. During the second half of 2022, renewal activities were started for the contract between BancoPosta and PostePay SpA for collection and payment services, which expires on 31 December 2022. The new contract, with a duration of one year, was signed in March 2023.

<sup>106.</sup> Contracts whereby BancoPosta Assets assigns operational or control activities to functions of Poste Italiane. The Operating Guidelines establish, among other things, the applicable levels of service and transfer prices and are effective following an authorisation process involving the relevant functions, the Chief Executive Officer and, where required, the Company's Board of Directors. Please refer to the Information on BancoPosta RFC in the Separate Statement of BancoPosta Assets as at 31 December 2022 in this Annual Report for further details.

Net interest income amounted to €1,923 million, an increase of 33.4% (+€481 million).

In particular, interest income of €2,095 million, up 36.7% on the €1,533 million of the previous year (+€562 million), includes income deriving from investments in securities, interest-bearing deposits at the MEF, tax credits, repurchase agreements and derivatives collateralisation. The change in the item is mainly due to the higher income from investments in tax credits purchased with reference to the Relaunch Decree No. 34/2020 (subsequently converted into Law No. 77/2020) and the investments with the MEF of deposits from postal current accounts belonging to public customers, whose yield is variable and is calculated on a basket of government bonds.

Interest expense, which is essentially attributable to current account transactions, repurchase agreement transactions and collateralisation of derivative transactions, amounted to €172 million and was up compared to €91 million in 2021 (+€81 million equal to +89%). The change in this item is mainly due to the increase in interest paid to public customers on postal current account balances.

Net fee and commission income amounted to €3,238 million, down 2.5% from €3,321 million in the same period of the previous year (-€83 million). Fee income amounted to €3,454 million, a decrease of €135 million (-3.7%) compared to 2021. The negative change mainly reflects the effect of lower revenues from postal savings collection and commissions on slips, and is mitigated by an improvement in insurance brokerage revenues, higher commissions received for the placement and promotion of products issued by PostePay, and the repricing of commissions on account-keeping with customers. Fee expenses amounted to €216 million, down from €267 million in 2021 (-€51 million, or -19.1%). The negative change was mainly due to lower costs accrued under the service contract signed with PostePay SpA.

The Profits/(Losses) on trading (negative by €68 million) and hedging (positive by €18 million), is attributable respectively to the effect of charges generated by derivative instruments entered into to hedge the index linked component to which the remuneration of government borrowing is linked, and the positive effect of the ineffectiveness component of existing hedging derivatives.

Net income from disposals of financial assets amounted to €335 million, down on the €407 million of 2021 (-€72 million, -17.7%).

Profits/(losses) on financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through Profit or loss is positive and equal to €1 million, mainly due to the positive change in the fair value of the Visa Incorporated shares.

Net operating expenses, which totalled €4,633 million, included administrative expenses of €4,627 million and other operating income of a negative €6 million. Administrative expenses were up 4.1% year-on-year, and operating income was down from the positive €8 million recorded in 2021.

Net provisions for liabilities and charges showed a positive balance of €21 million, compared to a negative balance of €48 million in the previous year. This positive change was affected by the revised estimate of certain risks related to the distribution of the money order product and legal disputes with third parties relating to BancoPosta's RFC.

Net adjustments and reversals for credit risk amounted to -€1 million (+€4 million as at 31 December 2021). The item reflects the combined effect of higher charges related to value adjustments linked to Expected Credit Losses on the securities portfolio and reversals related to the release of an impairment provision to cover an impaired loan, collected in early 2023.

After taking into account taxation for the period of €231 million (€189 million at 31 December 2021), net profit for the year 2022 for BancoPosta RFC amounted to €602 million, an increase of €94 million (equal to +18.5%) compared to the previous year (€508 million).

{251}------------------------------------------------

Assets are represented by cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and hedging derivatives, tax assets and other assets.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €5,874 million at 31 December 2022 (€7,680 million at 31 December 2021, -€1,806 million) and included, for a total of €3,984 million, cash at Post Offices and at cash transportation companies, as well as balances on the account with the Bank of Italy for interbank settlements of €1,855 million.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss amounted to €40 million and were mainly attributable to the fair value of 32,059 Visa Incorporated (Series C Convertible Participating Preferred Stock) and 1,019 Visa Incorporated (Series A Preferred Stock) and the change of which from 31 December 2021 is shown in Net income from financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income amounted to €33,161 million (€37,626 million at 31 December 2021, -€4,465 million) and include investments in mainly Italian government bonds. The decrease in this item is mainly due to the change in the fair value of securities in the portfolio, amounting to €10,126 million, only partially offset by the positive balance between sales/redemptions and new purchases of securities, amounting to €5,405 million.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost amounted to €46,576 million (€53,733 million at 31 December 2021, -€7,157 million) and are attributable both to investments in Italian government bonds and securities guaranteed by the Italian government for €27,699 million (€33,110 million at 31 December 2021, -€5,411 million) and to sundry deposits and receivables for €18,877 million (€20,624 million at 31 December 2021, -€1,747 million).

With regard to Financial Assets relating to investments in bonds issued by the Italian government and backed by the Italian government, the reduction for the year was the combined result of the reduction in the fair value of securities hedged with fair value hedge derivatives (-€5,398 million) and the negative balance between sales/redemptions of securities and new purchases (for -€42 million). With reference to Financial Assets referring to deposits and sundry receivables, the decrease of 1,743 compared to 2021 was mainly due to the reduction in: (i) loans and deposits with the MEF of €804 million (from €14,697 million at 31 December 2021 to €13,893 million at 31 December 2022); (ii) guarantee deposits of €2,401 million (from €4,858 million at 31 December 2021 to €2,457 million at 31 December 2022); (iii) trade receivables for €18 million (from €818 million at 31 December 2021 to €800 million at 31 December 2022); these changes are partially offset by the increase of €171 million in receivables relating to the balance of cash transactions on which collections and payments with third parties are settled through Poste Italiane, which went from €178 million at 31 December 2021 to €349 million at 31 December 2022 and the increase in accounting changes in loan repurchase agreements for €1,358 million.

The change in loans and deposits with the MEF is mainly attributable to lower funding from the Public Administration; the reduction in guarantee deposits is mainly attributable to the improvement in the fair value of hedging derivatives, recorded both on the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet offset by higher deposits paid as collateral in repo liabilities, as the fair value of pledged securities decreased.

Hedging derivatives with a positive fair value at 31 December 2022 amounted to €6,109 million (€873 million at 31 December 2021, +€5,236 million). The change is mainly due to the overall rise in interest rates, which has a positive impact on the fair value of the derivatives portfolio, as these are, for the most part, interest rate swaps to hedge the securities portfolio, which transform the yield of the latter from fixed to variable.

Tax assets amounted to €1,157 million, an increase of €874 million compared to €283 million as of 31 December 2021, mainly due to changes in deferred tax assets in equity or to changes in valuation reserves.

Other Assets, which amounted to €11,521 million (€8,838 million as of 31 December 2021, +€2,683 million), increased substantially due to tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane SpA and allocated, net of offsets, to BancoPosta RFC, and recognised at 31 December 2022 at €8.6 billion (with a nominal value of approximately €9.7 billion).

The principal liabilities are represented by financial liabilities, hedging derivatives, tax liabilities, other liabilities and provisions.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost amounted to €98,944 million (€95,799 million at 31 December 2021, +€3,145 million) and include: (i) amounts due to customers of €86,094 million (€85,098 million at 31 December 2021, +€996 million) attributable to funding through current accounts, repurchase agreements and payables for guarantee deposits paid by counterparties; (ii) payables to banks for €12,850 million (€10,701 million at 31 December 2021, +€2,149 million) attributable, also in this case, to current account relationships and repurchase agreement transactions and payables for deposits in guarantee paid by the banking counterparties.

Financial liabilities held for trading, amounting to €4 million, represent the fair value of derivative instruments entered into to hedge the fair value of the Visa shares mentioned above.

{252}------------------------------------------------

Hedging derivatives relating to securities in portfolio with negative fair vale amounted to €971 million (€5,461 million at 31 December 2021, -€4,490 million). The reasons for the change are described in Hedging Derivatives with Positive Fair Value.

Tax liabilities amounted to €225 million, a decrease of €445 million, compared to €670 million at the end of fiscal year 2021, due to changes in deferred taxes in fiscal year 2022 related to financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.

Other liabilities amounted to €2,789 million (€2,535 million at 31 December 2021, +€254 million), mainly include items of a tax nature by way of substitute tax and items in progress.

The Provision for employee termination benefits, amounting to approximately €2 million, is in line with the amount at 31 December 2021.

Provisions for risks and charges, which include amounts set aside to cover disputes and charges with personnel, customers and third parties in general, as well as various risks arising from BancoPosta's operations, amounted to €188 million, down €41 million on 31 December 2021. The change in this item was affected by the revision of estimates of certain risks related to litigation with third parties.

BancoPosta RFC at 31 December 2022 amounted to €1,314 million (€4,373 million at 31 December 2021, -€3,059 million). The negative change was mainly due to the decrease of €3,341 million in Valuation reserves, which went from €1,118 million at 31 December 2021 to -€2,223 million at 31 December 2022 due to the decrease in Fair value reserves for financial assets. With reference to the other components, the following should be noted: (i) the Reserve for BancoPosta RFC, totalling €2,585 million (increased by €188 million compared with 31 December 2021); (ii) the Reserve for retained earnings of previous years, totalling €1,373 million, which has been increased by €200 million following the shareholders' resolution of 27 May 2022 to allocate BancoPosta's 2021 net profit to BancoPosta RFC and decreased by €12 million due to interest expense, net of tax effects, accrued on Equity Instruments (iii) Capital Instruments, which remain unchanged at €350 million and relate to a perpetual subordinated loan with a non-call period of 8 years, granted on 30 June 2021 under terms and conditions that allow it to be counted as Additional Tier 1 capital; (iv) Net profit for 2022 of €602 million (€508 million in 2021).

### BancoPosta RFC's internal control and risk management system

The elements that characterise BancoPosta's Control Area107, understood as the general context in which company resources carry out their activities and perform their responsibilities, are primarily represented by:

- z the Group Code of Ethics;
- z the Organisational Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 and the related corporate procedures;
- z the organisational structure of BancoPosta, as reflected in organisational charts, service orders, organisational notices and procedures determining the roles and responsibilities of the various functions;
- z General Regulation governing the process of assignment and outsourcing of BancoPosta RFC, which respectively regulates the assignment of RFC operations to Poste Italiane functions in terms of decision-making processes, the minimum content of operating guidelines, levels of services, information flows and control procedures, and the process of outsourcing BancoPosta functions to third parties of the Poste Italiane organisation, identifying the related operational phases and the roles and responsibilities of the various bodies and functions involved in the process;
- z the Guidelines in the Internal Control and Risk Management System (also "SCIGR"), describing the roles and duties of BancoPosta RFC's control Functions, and the procedures for coordinating and ensuring the exchange of information between these Functions and Poste Italiane's control Functions and the flow of information to corporate bodies;
- z the system used for delegating powers to function heads in accordance with their responsibilities.

With regard to BancoPosta's structure, the organisational model in place envisages control functions equipped with the requisites of autonomy and independence, with respect to both the corresponding functions of Poste Italiane and the operational functions of BancoPosta, in accordance with the provisions of the specific Supervisory regulations of the Bank of Italy: Risk Management and Outsourcing Governance, Compliance and Internal Auditing. The risk assessment techniques, methods, controls and periodic audit findings are shared amongst the above control functions to promote synergies and take advantage of the specific expertise available. In line with the above mentioned provisions of the Assignment and Outsourcing Process Regulation, BancoPosta, also in the area of controls, relies on the contribution of other Poste Italiane functions.

<sup>107.</sup> Represents one of the most relevant components of the internal control system, i.e. a body of rules, procedures and organisational structures, which aim to prevent or limit the consequences of unexpected events and enable the achievement of strategic, operating objectives, compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, and ensure the fairness and transparency of internal and external reporting.

{253}------------------------------------------------

In compliance with the regulatory requirements contained in the Supervisory Standards of the Bank of Italy and CONSOB to which BancoPosta is subject, in early 2023 BancoPosta's Internal Auditing function prepared its 2022 Annual Report, the purpose of which is to provide information to the various corporate bodies on the completeness, adequacy, functionality and reliability of the overall system of controls of BancoPosta.

The Report was prepared on the basis of the findings of the audit activities carried out by the function and set out in the 2022 Audit Plan. The report contains information on the outcomes of the audit of the services contracted out by BancoPosta to Poste Italiane's Functions under operating guidelines and the activities outsourced to providers external to the Company. The activity revealed a situation of overall adequacy with the highlighting of certain aspects of attention addressed by management with specific strengthening actions.

The Annual Report, presented to the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Board of Directors, was subsequently submitted to the Bank of Italy. The specific section regarding investment services was, on the other hand, submitted to CONSOB.

The final audits were in part performed with reference to the findings of Poste Italiane's Internal Auditing function, which is responsible, in accordance with the specific operating guidelines for the IT audit and the audit of the local units and distribution channels within Poste Italiane's network, which are responsible for BancoPosta's processes and products.

Internal Auditing has also drawn up the Annual 2023 and Multi-year (2023-2025) Audit Plan, based on a risk assessment process designed to ensure adequate coverage of BancoPosta's Business Process Model, including risks, changing aspects of the business, regulatory issues and BancoPosta RFC's organisational structures.

This Plan has been presented to the Board of Statutory Auditors and submitted for the attention of the Board of Directors.

### Risk management system

BancoPosta RFC has an independent Risk Management unit, responsible for ensuring, among other things, in collaboration with the Group Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function of Poste Italiane SpA, an integrated, retrospective and prospective view of the risk environment and of BancoPosta RFC's capital and organisational adequacy. The function provides a detailed evaluation of the risk profile of the financial products sold, and provides the operational and business functions involved in product development and placement with advice and support. It is also responsible for periodic reporting. During 2022, the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF)108 was revised. The 2021 Annual Report and the programme of activities for 2022 were submitted to the Board of Statutory Auditors, the Control and Risk Committee and the Board of Directors, as were the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process)109 report and the Public Risk Report for 2021. These bodies also received quarterly reports on the performance of the effective risk profile versus the determined risk appetite. The principal types of risk to which BancoPosta RFC is exposed in the course of its ordinary activities are described below:

- z credit risk (including counterparty risk);
- z market risk (including banking book rate risk);
- z liquidity risk;
- z operational risk.

As regards the development of relevant risks, 2022 was characterised by an increase in Italian government bond yields (10-year BTP 4.72% as at 31 December 2022, +351 bps since the beginning of the year) and in the 10-year BTP-Bund spread (214 bps at the end of December 2022, 82 bps higher than at the beginning of the year).

The evolution of interest rates and the spread led to a reduction in net capital gains at portfolio level, going from over €2.1 billion of capital gains in December 2021 to around €7.2 billion of capital losses at the end of December 2022.

With regard to BancoPosta's capital structure, the Leverage Ratio stood at 2.9% in December 2022, the CET 1 Ratio at 20.3% and the Total Capital Ratio at 23.1%, confirming BancoPosta's capital strength.

Details of the various areas of risk and the methods used for their measurement and prevention are provided in other sections of the Annual Report of Poste Italiane for the year ended 31 December 2022.

<sup>108.</sup> The BancoPosta RAF is the framework of reference that defines - in keeping with the maximum acceptable risk, the business model and strategic plan - the risk appetite, risk tolerance thresholds, risk limits and risk management policies, together with the processes needed to define and implement them.

<sup>109.</sup> Bank of Italy defines the internal processes for determining capital adequacy in the Supervisory Provisions for Banks Part One - Transposition of CRD IV Directive Title III - Prudential Control Process Chapter 1 - Prudential Control Process.

### BancoPosta RFC events after 31 December 2022

No significant events occurred after the end of the financial year that would have an impact on the result.

## Outlook for BancoPosta RFC

In the Postal Savings segment, monitoring of developments in the economic context will continue in order to adapt the range of products offered to market conditions and changing customer needs, including with the introduction of new products issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. In the course of 2023, activities aimed at developing and releasing projects supported by appropriate communication activities and aimed at expanding the digitalisation of customers and improving the customer experience on all sales channels will continue. Specifically, an evolution of the Libretto Smart is planned that will allow for an improvement in the functionalities and services that customers can use from an omnichannel perspective.

With regard to Investments, the expansion of the product range will continue with the launch of new products. A new combined offer between a restricted current account and a plan of scheduled deposits into mutual funds will also be launched: the mechanism involves the deposit of an initial sum into the current account and subsequent monthly transfers from it to a managed mutual fund.

In the Personal Protection segment, a restyling of the personal line products is planned, which aims to simplify accident and health covers, including the new Temporary Death coverage. The first quarter of 2023 will see the start of the release of the new coverage and underwriting process for Credit Protection Insurance, the optional coverage provided to customers taking out a BancoPosta loan.

In the area of Business Protection, in the second half of 2023, the new collective policy 'Poste Welfare Infortuni', dedicated to covering the risks of occupational and extra-professional accidents of employees of contracting companies, will be placed at post offices through the network of Small Business Specialists.

With regard to Pensions, new developments are planned with regard to the advisory platform used in Post Offices concerning the internalisation of the cost sheet and refinements on the target market.

In the current account segment, with a view to improving the digitalisation of the BancoPosta account, a revised BancoPosta app account opening application service will be made available in early 2023, introducing various simplifications, including customer identification via SPID and digital omni-channelling, i.e. the ability to switch from the app channel to the web and vice versa during the application process.

As of 1 April 2023, as market rates structurally return to positive territory, the current account fee will decrease due to the reinstatement of conditions prior to the increase on 1 July 2022. BancoPosta, in fact, had undertaken to monitor the trend of the monthly average of the 6-month Euribor rate in order to verify that the conditions that had led to the increase in the aforementioned charges were no longer in place. In the course of 2023, the possibility of opening the BancoPosta account in the corners within many post offices will be activated in order to increase the possibility of access to the service, and the sales front end of the current account will be migrated to the Single Front End in order to simplify the sales process and bring it into line with that already operating for other products.

In the area of credit cards, in view of the changed market scenario, which saw an increase in the operating costs incurred by the issuer Deutsche Bank, during the first quarter of 2023, the fee for the Classica and Gold credit cards issued from the start of the placement to 31 December 2020 will increase. Excluded from this change are cards reserved for the categories of Employees and Pensioners of the Poste Group and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and Employees and Pensioners of the Companies subject to the management and coordination of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti for whom, in the first quarter of 2023, Deutsche Bank will replace the existing cards, operating on the Mastercard international payment circuit, with new cards adhering to the Visa international payment circuit.

In the first half of 2023, corporate financing will be further enhanced by the launch of a new partnership. The extension of the Quinto BancoPosta offer to employees of other "semi-public" companies is also planned for the first quarter of 2023.

With regard to Business and Public Administration current accounts, developments for the migration from all lists to the "Conto BancoPosta Business Link" will be completed during 2023. In addition, new digital services such as the *[SEPA Instant Credit](#page-485-0)  [Transfer](#page-485-0)*  (SCT instant) will be developed.

During 2023, the cash disbursement of the livelihood contribution will continue at the Post Office network in favour of persons from Ukraine seeking temporary protection and who have found independent accommodation, as provided for in the Convention signed with the Civil Protection Department.

# Work with transparency and integrity

Poste Italiane recognises ethics and transparency as founding values of the corporate identity, as they support the Company in driving a responsible business and managing relations with stakeholders in a direct and transparent way. Compliance with regulations, internal and external policies and codes of conduct, respect for rules and the strictest fairness are elements of strategic importance for the Group and are the basis for preventing any situation of conflict that may arise between corporate and personal interests.

#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

Poste Italiane signatory of the Global Compact principles The Group is a member of the UN Global Compact and has prepared in 2021 a Communication on Progress at "Advanced" level

#### Since 2003, Poste Italiane has adopted its own Organisational Model, which is continuously updated in line with regulatory, organisational and business developments, with the aim of building a structured and organic system of guiding principles, operating procedures and other specific safeguards, inspired by criteria of sound business management and aimed, in line with the Company's purpose, at preventing the commission of the offences set out in the Decree, as well as protecting the interests of stakeholders relevant to the Company itself.

The Model consists of a General Section and Special Sections, each of which relates to a class of offence relevant to the Company. The General Section provides a description, adapted to the business specificity of Poste Italiane, of the contents explicitly required by Legislative Decree 231/2001, (e.g. the regulation, the governance of the Company, the Supervisory Board, training/ information activities, the system of sanctions, etc.) as well as the Company's integrated internal control and risk management system (e.g. the integrated risk management process, the Company Regulatory System, the Group's Code of Ethics and Policies, the Corporate Governance System); the individual Special Sections outline, according to a logic based on processes, the different types of offences concretely and potentially relevant in the Company, as well as the corporate processes, sensitive activities, rules of conduct and specific control principles analysed for each class of offence.

In Poste Italiane's Model 231, sustainability issues are also of significant importance, in line with the Company's current strategic direction and in consideration of the correlations and synergies between them and Decree 231. Model 231 constitutes a tool that, through the identification of specific control measures to prevent the perpetration of offences ascribable to Decree 231, also contributes to supporting the Company in the realisation of the material topics defined by it within the 8 Pillars of Sustainability that contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Poste Italiane, with a view to strengthen and continually improve its Internal Control and Risk Management System, promptly adapted to recent regulatory developments concerning non-cash payment instruments and cultural heritage, given the Company's important role in financial intermediation, as well as the importance of movable and immovable assets subject to cultural protection and in the Company's possession.

Following the recent regulatory developments mainly concerning non-cash payment instruments, cultural heritage and public disbursements, the Risk Assessment and 231 Gap Analysis was updated, by verifying the adequacy of internal organisational and procedural tools.

Following the aforementioned analyses, activities were carried out to update the Organisation, Management and Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, aimed at ensuring its adequacy and suitability.

Model 231 "The principles

that guide our organisation in the management of business activities."

MODELLO DI ORGANIZZAZIONE, GESTIONE E CONTROLLO DI POSTE ITALIANE S.P.A. AI SENSI DEL DECRETO LEGISLATIVO N. 231/2001

In order to clearly define the values and social role with which the Company contributes to the processes of cohesion, inclusion and sustainability of the country, as well as the rules of conduct in the performance of professional activities, the Poste Italiane Group has adopted a Code of Ethics for directors, supervisory bodies, management, all employees and all those

who work, directly or indirectly, permanently or temporarily, to pursue the objectives of Poste Italiane. The Code is disseminated to all levels of the organisation with the aim of spreading its values, including through training and information initiatives, as the Company requires that all persons to whom the document is addressed become aware of its contents.

MODELLO DI ORGANIZZAZIONE, GESTIONE E CONTROLLO DI POSTE ITALIANE S.P.A. - Edizione ottobre 2022

{263}------------------------------------------------

The Code enshrines the principles that inspire the culture, behaviour and way of doing business of the Company and its stakeholders, such as the principle of legality, impartiality and fairness, respect and development of people, transparency and completeness, confidentiality, quality, diligence and professionalism. In this document, Poste Italiane affirms its commitment to adopting criteria of conduct that exclude conflicts of interest with the Group and promote the ability to make decisions that are consistent with the Company's objectives; criteria that avoid corruption, money laundering and terrorism and that encourage conduct of integrity, while respecting the health and safety of workers and protecting the privacy of all the recipients of the Code.

In addition to the Code of Ethics, the Company adopted a Group Integrated Policy, which reflects and documents the commitment made to all Company's stakeholders, to improve its performance and, at the same time, build and develop trusting relationships with them, as part of a process of generating and sharing value for the Company as well as for the communities in which it operates, with a view to achieving continuity and reconciliation of the related interests. In order to further emphasise the central importance of Integrity and transparency issues in relations with all the Group's stakeholders also in line with the requirements of ISO 37301 - Compliance Management Systems, the Integrated Policy was integrated with the principles and activities related to compliance management.

In addition, Poste Italiane has set up a reporting system and an Ethics Committee with the task of managing reports and violations. In this regard, the Group has introduced the "Guideline on Whistleblowing", a document aimed at regulating the system through which reports can be made by personnel and third parties, with reference to acts or facts referable to violations of internal and/or external regulations, as well as illegal or fraudulent conduct that may determine, directly or indirectly, a financial or image damage for the Company. The Group has made a reference portal available to the recipients of the Guidelines, the management of which is entrusted to the Whistleblowing Committee, which also performs the functions of the Ethics Committee and is responsible for receiving, examining and evaluating the communications received. The Whistleblowing Committee envisages assigning to an external professional with high standards of professionalism, honourableness and independence and the permanent presence within the Committee of the Group Risk Management structure/Oversight 231, in order to ensure constant assessment of the relevance of the reports received.

Poste Italiane's internal system for reporting violations is further strengthened by the provisions of the Organisation, Management and Control Model, prepared pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01 and approved by the Board of Directors as of October 2022. With reference to the management and monitoring of corporate risks, the Company, as part of its Internal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR), has adopted and implemented a management system that, through an organic and integrated vision, is able to provide an unequivocal and effective response to the risks to which the Group is exposed, thus defining an integrated risk management process.

The integrated compliance Model adopted by the Company fits into this context, creating operational synergies between the various compliance risk specialists and guaranteeing unified governance in the management of these risks, thanks also to a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the players involved in the process. This Model has been formalised in the Integrated Compliance Guideline, drafted in line with best practices and in particular with the provisions of the new ISO 37301:2021 (Compliance Management Systems), becoming a further fundamental pillar for the strengthening of the SCIGR, with the specific purpose of guarding against the risks of non-compliance to which the Group is exposed, thus fully implementing the principles of integrity, transparency and legality.

Moreover, in line with the Group's Integrated Compliance Process and in order to respond to the Group's opening to the international market as a result of significant agreements and the acquisition of foreign companies, Poste Italiane has defined the Foreign Compliance Process that disciplines governance aspects and reporting flows to and from the Parent Company, as well as the operating procedures at the level of individual Foreign Group Companies for the execution of the various compliance activities.

{264}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane's Compliance Day: "Compliance, a strategy for global challenges"

On 28 November 2022, Poste Italiane's first Compliance Day "Compliance, a strategy for global challenges"was held. Its purpose was, on the one hand, to bring together Poste Italiane's Compliance Professional Family in an institutionalised format, with the contribution to the work of the heads of important Compliance functions at central level and within the Group, and, on the other hand, to maintain the training profile, broadening the participation to the heads of corporate functions and structures affected by the widespread application of regulations and by the management of compliance risks. The event, which took place in the Palazzo delle Poste in Piazza San Silvestro and virtually via the Microsoft Teams platform, involved around 1,400 participants, of which 40 in attendance (managers and members of the main functions within the Compliance professional family) and the remainder through a remote connection (managers and executives responsible up to the fifth level of the Group). In line with Poste Italiane's commitment to disseminating the culture of Compliance at all levels in a

context - characterised by the health emergency, the economic crisis and geo-political instability - that continues to confront the Company with increasingly demanding challenges, the event was an opportunity for all Poste Italiane's Compliance people and professionals to meet and exchange views, which saw the commitment also of the Top Management reaffirmed in the operational and daily management of non-compliance risks as an essential component of the strategy for sustainable development.

Compliance with the UNI ISO 37001 standard, relating to anti-corruption management systems, represents an opportunity for Poste Italiane to strengthen its commitment to fight corruption and contribute to consolidating the principle of legality, with obvious benefits for the protection of the Company's reputation and assets. As far as Group companies are concerned, after Poste Vita, PostePay, BancoPosta Fondi SGR, SDA Express Courier head office and Poste Assicura obtained the certification (as of 2019), in 2022, EGI and Postel also obtained this certification, which was extended to the territorial areas of SDA Express Courier.

EGI and Postel obtain the ISO 37001 certification

ISO 37301 "Compliance management systems - Requirements with guidance for use" governs the elements necessary for an organisation to develop, implement, maintain and improve an effective Compliance Management System, focusing on the importance of spreading a culture of compliance within the organisation that contributes to the pursuit of sustainable success. In April 2022, Poste Italiane was the first company in Italy to obtain this certification from IMQ for the management of Integrated Compliance to oversee the processes of design, development and delivery of Postal, Financial and Logistical Services in the areas of administrative, accounting and fiscal responsibility.

In 2022, Poste Italiane also obtained ISO 37002 "Whistleblowing", an international standard aimed at providing a comprehensive guide to help organisations define, develop, implement, and effectively maintain a Management System on the process of receiving and handling whistleblowing.

Poste Italiane obtains ISO 37301 and ISO 37002 certifications

As evidence of Poste Italiane's commitment to disseminating the principles of integrity, preventing corruption and ensuring regulatory compliance, the Company adopted a Groupwide Competition and Consumer Protection Compliance programme and drew up the "Guideline on Competition and Consumer Protection Compliance", which is the cornerstone of the programme.

The document provides indications on the regulations for the protection of competition and the consumer and defines the rules of conduct that all members of corporate bodies, executives, employees and all those who work to achieve the Group's purpose and objectives must observe. In particular, the objectives set out in the document concern: ensuring compliance with competition and consumer protection rules, of which no violation is tolerated; strengthening awareness and disseminating knowledge about the importance of competition and consumer protection regulations; consolidating an operating and control environment that mitigates the risk of commission of antitrust and anti-competitive offences as well as violation of consumer protection regulations; providing guidance to prevent actions, behaviours and omissions that violate competition and consumer protection regulations, and outlining monitoring tools to identify any violations.

{265}------------------------------------------------

#### Poste Italiane and Guardia di Finanza together to ensure legality and transparency

The historic collaboration with Guardia di Finanza (Finance Policy) and the signed protocol provide even more effective and up-to-date tools to counter any abuse and make a concrete contribution to the country's development.

The Memorandum of Understanding with Guardia di Finanza consolidates the entrenchment of company standards and rules in processes, through the increasingly widespread dissemination of the principles of legality and transparency in the market and the prevention of financial offences. In particular, within the framework of the Protocol, the shared objectives are the fight against tax evasion, avoidance and fraud, offences relating to public expenditure, economic and financial crime, money laundering, counterfeiting and fraud concerning payment systems. The Protocol also stipulates that Poste Italiane shall assist in the work of prevention and law enforcement by sharing with Guardia di Finanza its wealth of information against unlawful acts in areas of institutional interest carried out also by exploiting technological and IT means. Under the agreement, Poste Italiane will make available to Guardia di Finanza the data in the "Identity Check" system, which will be useful for investigations to prevent and repress fraud and any other offence of an economic or financial nature. The Protocol also establishes regular meetings to review the progress of the collaboration and share information on new fraud scenarios and initiatives to be implemented.

#### Poste Italiane and Arma dei Carabinieri

Through the Memorandum of Understanding with Arma dei Carabinieri, Poste Italiane consolidates the rooting of company rules and regulations in its processes and strongly reaffirms - internally and externally - the organisation's position on issues of legality, safety at work and training. On the basis of the Protocol with Arma dei Carabinieri, Poste Italiane also relies on the expertise of the Carabinieri to ensure maximum compliance with labour, social security and work safety regulations at construction sites opened for building work at Poste Italiane premises.

A further element in the path undertaken by Poste Italiane to pursue sustainable success, including through activities aimed at the evolution and streamlining of governance controls and the continuous strengthening of the SCIGR in compliance with the principles of integrity, transparency and legality, as well as to efficiently and uniformly cope with the growing complexity of the various legislative and regulatory requirements, is the Internal Control System on Financial Reporting.

In line with the strategic guidelines defined by the Company, the internal control system on financial reporting, through the analysis of risks and the identification of specific control measures, is therefore among the tools useful to contribute to the achievement of the objectives related to the material topic of working with integrity and transparency.

The "Internal Control System on Financial Reporting" Guidelines (hereinafter also referred to as "SCIIF") defines the rules and methods for establishing and maintaining the Poste Italiane Group's system of internal control over financial reporting over time, as well as for assessing its effectiveness. These standards and methodologies are consistent with the regulatory provisions and the market main best practices as well as with the Internal Control and Risk Management System Guidelines adopted by Poste Italiane SpA and with the Group's Integrated Risk Management and Compliance processes. By adopting such an integrated model, it is possible to ensure synergies between the specialised units of the various compliance areas and to avoid redundancies in the operational activities of risk management models and specific compliance programmes, rationalising processes, optimising the effectiveness and efficiency of control activities, and facilitating the sharing of information between the various second-level functions.

In order to prevent and fight fraudulent phenomena, Poste Italiane carries out verification, assessment and monitoring activities on individuals and counterparties (corporate, financial and asset analyses on companies and exponents, analysis of existing relations with Poste Italiane) through the identification of all the operational and reputational details necessary to verify the reliability and honourable-

ness of individuals or counterparties. Boosting prevention of illegal activities, via integrated analysis of information within and beyond Poste Italiane, enables detection of direct and indirect relations that highlight possible critical issues. The fight against fraudulent phenomena is therefore implemented through a process of continuous monitoring of the degree of exposure to the risk of fraud and risk factors, through the collection and analysis of reports and indications of potential wrongdoing, the review of processes and the adoption of adequate and increasingly rigorous measures of governance and control aimed at preventing fraud.

{266}------------------------------------------------

In 2022, projects and activities were implemented as part of the fraud prevention management process through an integrated anti-fraud system. In addition, initiatives for the evolution and adaptation of support information systems continued, in specifically with the Integrated Anti-fraud Platform (PIAF), an innovative fraud prevention system that includes all digital financial products and services of: On US Monetics, e-commerce and digital banking, based on predictive analytical models and enabling - in real time and subject to pre-authorisation mode (as required by the Regulations) - the monitoring of transactions ordered by customers. This platform includes the implementation of a single behavioural prevention/detection machine learning solution for all channels, and the subsequent start of the migration of all Payment Cards to the new Integrated Anti-fraud Platform (PIAF).

With the aim of disseminating the Group's ethical principles, Poste Italiane invests in training and information activities for its employees, offering seminars and courses on transparency, integrity and anti-corruption, communicating its principles to stakeholders through the dissemination of the Code of Ethics, Policies and Guidelines. Training and communication constitute, in fact, a continuum of coordinated actions aimed at supporting the dissemination of the culture of compliance and legality in line with the roles, responsibilities and levels of risk exposure of each individual, including through adequate top management commitment.

Legality rating

In 2022, Poste Italiane confirmed its legality rating, receiving the highest three star rating from the AGCM, which is awarded to just 8.7% of companies

# Fiscal transparency policies

In January 2020, both Poste Italiane and its subsidiary, Poste Vita, were admitted to the Collaborative Compliance regime with the tax authorities, an award granted following a positive assessment by the tax authorities of the system for identifying, managing, controlling and mitigating tax risk. This institution, provided for by the Delegated Law for the reform of the Italian tax system (Law 23/2014) and introduced in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 128/2015, allows for a relationship to be established with the financial authorities, one built on trust and collaboration. The goal is to increase the level of certainty on significant tax issues by creating an open line of communication so that issues that might give rise to risky tax scenarios are addressed in advance. Poste Italiane's admission to Collaborative Compliance consolidates the path inspired by the values of ethics, integrity and transparency also in the financial and fiscal area.

# Poste Italiane Tax Control Risk Framework

Poste Italiane has developed its own tax risk management and control system, which, as part of the wider Internal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR), meets the following requirements in line with legislation and best practices:

- z the Tax Strategy in which the Group has defined its objectives and the approach adopted in managing the tax variable. The Tax Strategy is arranged as a set of principles and rules aimed at promoting dissemination of the values of honesty, fairness and compliance with tax regulations, thereby encouraging the development of collaborative and transparent conduct towards the tax authorities and third parties, in order to minimise any substantial impact in terms of either tax or reputational risk;
- z adequate processes, procedures and tools for the detection, measurement and management of tax risks, as well as for monitoring the tax risk control system;
- z a system of delegated powers, roles and responsibilities regarding the processes of detecting, measuring, managing and monitoring tax risk, defined within a specific Guideline, as well as detailed in the relative operating procedures and in the tax risk map (i.e. Tax Risk Assessment);
- z adaptation to major changes affecting the Company, including changes in tax legislation;
- z sending an annual report to the management bodies containing the results of the checks carried out and any action plans to be implemented to remedy the shortcomings that emerged from the monitoring. This report is also sent to the Revenue Agency for evaluation of the Tax Control Framework.

In line with its sustainability strategy and with the values set out, in the Group's Code of Ethics, the Poste Italiane Group has always managed taxation in full compliance with the principles of honesty, fairness and compliance with tax regulations, characterised by cooperative and transparent conduct towards tax authorities and third parties, in order to minimise any material impact in terms of tax or reputational risk. To this 

{267}------------------------------------------------

end, the Group has adopted a Tax Strategy110 within which the Company has defined its objectives:

- z manage the tax variable by protecting the interests of all stakeholders, including the government, shareholders, employees and the community in which it operates, including at local level, being aware that tax revenue is one of the main sources of contribution to the economic and social development of the country;
- z always operate in compliance with tax regulations with regard to both the letter of the rules and the underlying rationale, monitoring and overseeing regulatory changes, including through continuous dialogue with the relevant institutions at national and international level;
- z make decisions on tax matters in line with national and international best practices and with the guidelines dictated by sector bodies, as well as in line with its own strategic objectives and risk appetite;
- z promote professional diligence in the management of tax-relevant activities and processes, and ensure that the related procedures are appropriate;
- z ensure adequate technical training for all employees involved in the management of tax-related obligations and activities;
- z establish complete and accurate information flows to management bodies and tax authorities;
- z encourage the development of constructive, professional and transparent relations with the Tax Authorities, based on the concepts of integrity, collaboration and mutual trust.

The Collaborative Compliance Regime admitted Poste Italiane and its subsidiary Poste Vita with the tax authorities

The tax risk management and control system implemented by the Group requires top management to be kept constantly informed of the tax consequences of all strategic and operational business transactions, both planned and to be carried out, thereby ensuring that every decision taken on tax matters is consistent with Poste Italiane's tax strategy and that the Tax function is involved in the preliminary assessment of the tax impact of such transactions. The Tax function is divided into eight areas that are assigned distinct roles and responsibilities and are: Tax Planning and Business Support, Tax Risk Management, Processes and Procedures, Regulations, Studies and Tax Substitution, Corporate Income, Indirect Taxes, Local Taxes and Litigation, VAT and IT Compliance and Oversight of tax obligations envisaged for financial intermediaries.

Poste Italiane SpA's Board of Directors, subject to the opinion of the Control and Risk Committee, is responsible for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system. To this end, with specific reference to the tax risk management and control system, the Board of Directors, supported by adequate preparatory work by the Control and Risk Committee, examines at least once a year the report prepared by the head of the Tax function containing the results of the periodic review of this system.

Poste Italiane also coordinates with Group companies to ensure that they operate in compliance with current tax legislation and in line with the Group's risk management and control system.

As previously stated when it entered the Collaborative Compliance regime, the Poste Italiane Group is committed to establishing relations with tax authorities that are based on the utmost transparency and cooperation, undertaking to:

- z communicate in a clear and transparent manner to the Revenue Agency any changes in the tax strategy, in the medium/long-term tax planning and the possible risks related to the most relevant transactions;
- z provide correct, accurate and timely information and respond promptly to questions and requests for information received by the Revenue Agency;
- z resolve any problems in a timely manner prior to the filing of tax returns, and, if differences subsequently arise, work out an agreement with the Revenue Agency to resolve them.

Following the Poste Italiane Group's entry into the Collaborative Compliance regime, the Group has adopted a well-structured set of procedures to govern the management of tax risk, including the activities, controls, roles and responsibilities defined within the processes.

Poste Italiane has also made it the responsibility of the Tax function to monitor updates to the relevant legislation. More specifically, the task of the Regulations, Studies and Tax Substitution (NSSI) unit, which is part of the Tax function, is to: monitor the evolution of the national, EU and international tax system, in order to propose measures to guarantee the interests of the Group and the optimisation of operating obligations; guarantee the study, interpretation and dissemination of tax regulations, assessing their impact on the Company and the Group in collaboration with internal functions/companies. To this end, the NSSI unit, thanks to the continuous exchange with the operational structures of reference, receives suggestions and input that give greater consistency to the actions implemented in this area. As part of the monitoring of regulations, the Processes and Procedures unit, in conjunction with other internal functions, analyses the impacts on processes and systems deriving from changes in tax regulations, defining the related adaptation plans. Finally, the Tax Risk Management unit monitors, with reference to the compliance plans developed by the Processes and Procedures unit, the proper execution of controls and related activities.

# Tax Risk Assessment

During 2022, an update of the Tax Risk Assessment was carried out, which entailed a review of Poste Italiane's tax risks, both in terms of existing risks and their assessment, as well as an updating of activities and the related controls, partly in order to exploit potential synergies with other control systems within the Company. In general, the review of the Tax Risk Assessment covered the following points:

- z updating of the tax risk map due to changes in tax legislation, the review of risks with a view to continuous improvement;
- z updating of the qualitative/quantitative assessment of tax risks, in line with the risk assessment methodology developed during 2020;
- z updating of the activities and related controls identified to mitigate tax risks in response to changes in tax legislation, of the organisational and process changes during the period, of any shortcomings in the design of controls identified during testing or with a view to continuous improvement in order to ensure the efficiency and harmonisation of Poste Italiane's existing control systems, and to increase the awareness of control owners regarding the methods of carrying out controls.

During 2022, the controls to guard against the risks envisaged within the framework of Poste Italiane's tax risk management and control system were monitored, in accordance with what was defined in the 2021 - 2023 Monitoring Plan and in line with the methodology adopted.

# Communication and training on tax issues

In accordance with what stated in the Tax Strategy and aware of the fundamental role played by training in an area such as the tax area characterised by rapid change, the Tax function trains and supports all personnel involved in the management of tax-related activities, not limiting itself to resources specifically dedicated to tax matters, in order to ensure that all personnel have the right skills and experience to fulfil their responsibilities.

During 2021, the courses delivered by the Tax function covered the following topics:

- z Communicating with the Revenue Agency: the obligations of financial intermediaries;
- z National Tax Consolidation Poste Italiane Group;
- z Corporate Taxation Direct Taxes;
- z M&A Tax implications of the main types of extraordinary transactions;
- z Functionalities and usage of the fiscal risk management platform (GRC-RSA Archer).

In 2022, however, consistent with the ongoing health emergency, training events are being planned in the following areas:

- z Tax concessions;
- z Course on VAT and postal services with a special focus on aspects related to tenders and direct awarding, as well as the new features of the tax decree (international VAT);
- z Definition of processes and identification of control points;
- z Registration and stamp duty on contracts;
- z Direct Taxes;
- z Significant tax regulations with an impact on Poste Italiane's international structure (Sources of international tax law - CFC - Dividends from companies in privileged tax countries - TP - Hybrid mismatches);
- z Voluntary tax correction/settlement;
- z Collection;
- z Tax substiution.

# Legality and incorporation of ESG criteria within the procurement processes

Poste Italiane manages its supply chain responsibly with the aim of certifying the sustainability, functionality and traceability of procurement. In this regard, in addition to ensuring compliance with current regulations and corporate directives, the Group is committed to basing its purchasing processes on pre-contractual and contractual relations based on the values of legality and transparency, with respect for agreements, payment methods and payment times at the centre. Therefore, within its supplier base, the Company includes those with adequate quality characteristics that guarantee the protection of workers and compliance with environmental standards.

Poste Italiane Group gives each supplier the opportunity to compete in the awarding procedures, guaranteeing equal opportunities and excluding preferential treatment. Suppliers involved are obliged to comply with the EU and Italian legislation on competition, and shall refrain from anti-competitive or unethical conduct that is contrary to the rules that safeguard competition. In addition, the Company requires suppliers including any subcontractors - and their partners to formally accept the guiding principles and criteria of conduct outlined in the Code of Ethics and Group Policies.

To select its suppliers, the Group is guided by objective and verifiable criteria, including ESG criteria, with the aim of ensuring fairness, impartiality, transparency and equal opportunities for collaboration

#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

Through internal rules, Poste Italiane regulates the procurement process both for contracts subject to the Public Contracts Code and for those excluded from the scope of the Code.

In order to encourage and improve relations with suppliers and to ensure efficient and integrated management of the supply chain in full compliance with the principles of confidentiality, authenticity, competitiveness, integrity and availability in the exchange of data, purchases are made on the PosteProcurement Purchasing Portal, an electronic system dedicated to procurement activities and the management of the Supplier Register.

The Group's purchasing procedures are in line with the trend of recent years and record a massive and constant recourse to competitive procedures capable of guaranteeing competitive advantages for the Company.

The purchasing process takes ESG issues into account with the aim of pursuing sustainable procurement, acting as a vehicle for disseminating the culture of sustainability - understood as the set of the Group's sustainable policies integrated within the Company's regulatory system and outlined in the purchasing process itself.

Finally, it should be noted that the purchasing activity is regulated by a regulatory and procedural framework which, together with the Internal Regulations for the Award of Works, Service and Supply Contract Procedures (approved in November 2017 and modified in July 2019) and the Public Contracts

{270}------------------------------------------------

Since 2021, Poste Italiane has been among the leading Italian economic and production companies qualified in the sustainable management of purchasing processes and supplier relations. The ISO 20400 certification on Sustainable Procurement defines guidelines for integrating sustainability into an organisation's procurement processes.

#### Poste Italiane receives the ISO 20400 certification

Code, if applicable, constitute the main governance and regulatory oversight of Poste Italiane's contract awards. In this regard, in order to pursue continuous improvement, the process of revising the procedural system started in 2021 continued in 2022, introducing, among other things, the ESG principles already in force, functional to sustainable procurement and consistent with the provisions of ISO 20400 certification, as well as strengthening the centrality of Business Process Management (BPM) as a tool for managing, dematerialising and tracking the liability cycle.

The Group's Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance Function in the Corporate Affairs area aims at recognising possible elements of risk to ensure compliance with the requirements of reliability and integrity, through the assessment of the corporate, financial and equity profiles of the companies and representatives of the respective relationships with the Company. In particular, relationships with suppliers can become sources of strategic and reputational risks. Risk management is aimed at limiting risks arising from transactions with third parties, ensuring adequate supplier rotation and minimising bad debt losses through constant monitoring. In order to enable the identification of direct and indirect relationships prone to criticality, it is necessary to strengthen the prevention of unlawful phenomena through an analysis that considers internal and external information. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Poste Italiane expanded the assessment process to include pandemic risk analysis.

The Poste Italiane Group's commitment has been recognised by the UN Global Compact Network Italia, which included the Group's example in the Position Paper "La gestione sostenibile delle catene di fornitura: tra responsabilità e opportunità per le imprese". The document, presented as part of the CSR and Social Innovation Fair, recognizes the commitment of several companies, including Poste Italiane, to the sustainable management of supply chains, and their ability to identify opportunities related to this challenge.

# Main types of goods and services purchased

Within real estate procurement, in 2022, all tenders for the supply of furniture, cleaning services and works included compliance with the Minimum Environmental Criteria (MEC). In particular, in works tenders, in order to reduce the environmental impact on natural resources and increase the use of recycled materials, thereby increasing waste recovery, specific award criteria have been adopted for the use of new materials produced with a certain percentage of recycled content and which, at the end of their life, can be subjected to selective demolition, recycling or reuse. For each product subject to the award score criteria, the production of a special sheet was required, giving a general description of the product and indicating the physical characteristics, marks, environmental labelling and certifications proving that it is made of recycled or environmentally friendly materials.

The concession contracts for catering services at the property complexes also comply with the principles of Green Public Procurement (GPP – Green Procurement of the Public Administration), to guarantee the provision of a corporate catering service with a reduced environmental impact characterised, in terms of processes and contents, by compliance with environmental, economic and social sustainability. Poste Italiane rewards the supply of foodstuffs, such as BIO, IGP, DOP, sustainable fishing products, etc., in excess of the minimum quantities prescribed by the MEC. In this context, local suppliers who guarantee certified products are potentially involved in the supply chain of food products for canteens and bars.

As far as the procurement of electricity for the Group is concerned, it is purchased from the reference market with 100% from certified renewable sources with guarantees of origin. A residual share of the requirements is self-produced by proprietary photovoltaic systems. In order to increase energy self-production, work is nearing completion on the installation of about 600 photovoltaic systems on the roofs of the Group's buildings, and the new tender for a further 1,000 interventions on the roofs of Post Offices as part of the Polis Project is being contracted out.

Postel's project initiative involving the construction of photovoltaic systems at its two production sites dedicated mainly to mass printing and industrial envelope stuffing activities is also significant: the first was installed in October 2022, and is located at the Melzo production centre, while the second was installed in December and is located at the Pomezia production centre. The installation covers a total area of 5,100 m2 with an energy production capacity of 1,210,000 kWh/year, corresponding to a CO2emission saving of 560 tonnes/year.

{271}------------------------------------------------

The largest photovoltaic plant in Lazio belongs to Poste Italiane

The new photovoltaic plant that went into operation at the Postel plant in Pomezia accelerates Poste Italiane's interventions in Lazio as well, which will enable the Company to reach the carbon neutrality target by 2030.

Consisting of 1,170 mono-crystalline panels on the roof of the Centre, for a total of 1,900 square metres corresponding to about 7 tennis courts, the largest photovoltaic system built by Poste Italiane in Lazio is one of the largest in Italy, has a power of about 400 KWp, an average annual production of about 490,000 kWh, and a saving of CO2 emissions into the environment of 260 tonnes, equal to the average annual emission of almost 87 households. In addition, the plant uses totally renewable electricity and the site lighting is 100% LED.

As part of the Smart Building project, 965 installations of micro-climate monitoring systems were carried out in 2022, bringing to 1,621 the number of sites equipped with continuous screening of optimal environmental comfort parameters (temperature and humidity), with a reduction in energy consumption of more than 15% compared to sites without them.

The commitment to the construction of recharging stations for hybrid or all-electric company vehicles also continues, with the purchase of 325 new columns that will be installed at company premises. Similarly, as part of the Polis Project, an EU tender was launched for the construction of a nationwide recharging infrastructure with 5,000 recharging stations that can be used by the community every day and at any time.

With regard to logistics procurement, with reference to the purchase of the main Full rent services of the operational and transport fleet, when tenders are being carried out, a bonus score is awarded to bids with lower CO2 emission classes, as well as compliance with the relevant MEC, where applicable.

For footwear and Personal Protective Equipment, as well as for the supply of work uniforms, the relevant MEC are observed and offers aimed at environmental sustainability, also in relation to the possibility of recycling packaging, are valued.

In the procurement of technological parcel and letter sorting equipment, special attention is paid to the prioritization of offers with low energy consumption solutions and noise reduction.

In addition, the tender for the supply of vehicle fuels by Fuel Card for Poste Italiane Group vehicles is under way. The technical offer of the tender, besides providing for the introduction of new card functionalities and attaching value to the capillarity of the network, emphasises sustainability through the requirement of environmental management, corruption prevention and occupational health and safety certifications, together with the realisation of the Fuel Cards with plantbased/recycled plastic materials.

With regards to ICT purchases, the IT requirements for printers, multifunctional equipment, desktop PCs and laptops were also procured in compliance with the basic and rewarding MEC under GPP. In particular, for the management of printing processes, a new category of "ink-jet" printers has been identified for Poste Italiane Offices, equipped with large capacity tanks and refillable with special ink bottles that significantly reduce the replacement of refill cartridges, leading to savings

# +965

#### micro-climate monitoring systems

on consumables and a significant reduction in plastic waste (packaging, spare parts, etc.). As well as helping to improve the quality of the working environment through zero ozone emissions, the new printers, relying on electronic optimisation in the printing process, enable the containment of running costs and a significant reduction in power consumption.

Lastly, as part of the verification of the technological obsolescence of the PCs used by company personnel and for which the operating system was found to be outdated, a "no replacement" project was launched with the aim of upgrading the devices, as an alternative to replacing them. This intervention, in addition to a significant economic saving, has in fact enabled the life of the equipment to be extended whilst reducing WEEE.

# Supplier qualification procedures

In line with the provisions of current legislation (Article 134 of the current Public Contracts Code), in 2006, the Poste Italiane Group set up its own Register of Suppliers to streamline award procedures and ensure consistency among selected parties, in all product areas, as well as transparency vis-à-vis the market.

The Regulation of the Suppliers' Register and the Regulation of the Qualification System, which respectively govern the Qualification System in the Suppliers' Register and the qualification system and procedure for each of the product categories, regulate the formation and management of the Register. For each product category, access to the Register can take place at any time by submitting an application and the required documentation.

All suppliers, in order to be qualified in the Register, must possess not only general requirements, i.e. moral quality and professional suitability, but also special requirements, including those of an economic-financial and technical-organisational nature. These enabling prerequisites aim at consolidating the governance of the Group's purchasing process.

{272}------------------------------------------------

Moreover, in the context of relations with suppliers of works, services and supplies, the contractual clauses with which Poste Italiane operates are continually updated on the basis of any new regulatory provisions and special requirements communicated by the internal customer. This contributes to the acceleration of contractual time and ensures adequate governance of the most significant issues.

Poste Italiane Group ensures a high level of disclosure of

# Selection of suppliers

The integration of environmental, social and governance aspects into Poste Italiane's purchasing procedures implies that suppliers undergo sustainability audits to verify that they meet specific requirements.

# +1.4%

of tenders carried out on the basis of environmental criteria compared to 2021

The Group pays special attention to the ESG aspects of supply chain management, recognizing that developing transparent and lasting relationships with suppliers, as well as paying the utmost attention to quality, respect for the environment, safety and social implications in the procurement process, can contribute to the public interest of the entire Country System111 and to the constant improvement of the service offered to its customers.

# 84.8%

of suppliers have an ISO 14001 or EMAS certified environmental management system

For this reason, there are specific environmental, social and governance criteria in the supplier selection process, in the participation requirements, in the evaluation parameters of the technical offer and/or in the contractual conditions, of the tender procedures carried out during the year. In particular, the Group, in relation to its relations with its suppliers, provides specific contractual clauses related to sustainability issues (e.g. human rights, health and safety at work, ethics, etc.).

Demonstrating the Group's commitment to these issues, significant increases were again reported in 2022 in relation to tenders held on the basis of environmental, social and governance criteria.

Specifically, 88.3% of suppliers, compared to 84.5% in 2021, were selected in accordance with specific social standards during 2022. Said indicator, when considered net of tenders its procurement process, in line with the principles of transparency. In fact, pursuant to Law No. 190/2012 entitled "Provisions for the prevention and repression of corruption and illegality in the public administration", it regularly and voluntarily publishes information on both the purchasing procedures indicated by law and those not expressly mentioned in the legislation. To guarantee said information flow, the "Open and Transparent Contracts" portal was created and can be consulted on the Company's website.

The Group maintained the governance indicator, introduced in 2021, by requiring specific qualification and evaluation principles from suppliers in the technical offer, in order to refine the ESG model in the procurement process. Analysing the tendering procedures launched with amounts above the EU thresholds, we obtain the figure that represents the initiatives with specific governance criteria in qualification, evaluation criteria (e.g. ISO 37001, Legality Rating, Code of Ethics/ Conduct, Policy etc.) and contractual clauses.

Of the tenders issued during the year, 52.3% took governance aspects into account, compared to 33% in the previous year. The same indicator, not including the tenders without the technical offer, certifies that almost all tenders launched require governance criteria (>80%).

The reporting scope refers to the current special sector procurement thresholds, conventionally extended to non-code tenders, for the lowest price (PBB) and economically most advantageous (OEPV) award criteria.

{274}------------------------------------------------

In 2019, the Group introduced the Green Procurement function in order to report on ESG issues within its supply chain management on a timely basis. This function is able to ensure a constant integration of sustainability issues within tender processes and ESG criteria in the technical evaluation of offers. The definition of highly relevant projects, such as logistics, decarbonisation of buildings, consumables, and by promoting a focus on resource utilisation, investment plans and technological development, together with the greening of more traditional requirements, promotes the achievement of the sustainable change objective.

The upward trend in Environmental, Social and Governance indicators is matched by the significant increase in the ESG relevance of the technical offer, measured in over 6 percentage points compared to last year, with the stable presence of criteria related to Environmental Management (65%), Occupational Health and Safety (64%), Attention to People (53.3%) and Integrity and transparency (52.3%). By encouraging the adoption of ESG criteria for selecting, evaluating and monitoring suppliers, as well as mitigating any ESG risks, Poste Italiane pursues the goal of increasing the effectiveness of business processes and competitiveness. In line with previous years and with the aim of combining sustainability in terms of reducing environmental impacts and rationalising costs, Poste Italiane Group has adopted the criteria set forth by the Green Public Procurement, implementing, where applicable, the Minimum Environmental Criteria (MEC), established by specific Ministerial Decrees. Furthermore, the ESG model in the Group's procurement process was implemented through the introduction of specific Integrity and transparency (Governance) criteria.

In the supplier qualification phase, in order to monitor their performance, Poste Italiane implemented a rating methodology characterised by the adoption of a customised approach, which resulted in the definition of an ad hoc questionnaire for each supplier (100% of qualified suppliers). The model is risk-based, as it allows for an assessment of how each provider manages the ESG risks identified as relevant according to the company's sector and size. As far as the sector is concerned, suppliers are classified by the Group within the 99 recognised ATECO sectors. As each sector

# 100%

of suppliers classified by ATECO sector and size is characterised by specific risks depending on the nature, the companies belonging to it are also affected by them and, consequently, are evaluated according to them. Poste Italiane used internationally recognised external references to identify the various types of risk, identifying around 40 main ones (environmental, social and socio-environmental). For each risk considered relevant to the sector in question, an evaluation of the companies is carried out considering the specific safeguards adopted to mitigate the negative impact of the individual risks examined. With regard to the size of the organisation, on the other hand, which according to the European Commission's regulations can be small, medium or large, the Company highlighted 8 main Governance risks potentially relevant for the suppliers under assessment.

#### Specific ESG Ratings

assigned for the selection of suppliers on the basis of the controls used to manage the various relevant risks

Subsequently, the information obtained is analysed and processed through the definition of an ESG scoring process that involves, for each aspect analysed, the attribution of a rating for each relevant risk and a total ESG rating.

These elements provide the model with the following strengths:

- z assessment focused on the supplier's relevant ESG risks, through the use of a specific questionnaire for each economic sector (risk-based approach);
- z strength of the analysis thanks to the use of a quantitative algorithm, which guarantees the attribution of a rating which is extremely representative of the level of risk coverage guaranteed by the supplier;
- z risk visibility on different levels, with the opportunity to analyse ESG risk at the aggregate level, at the level of single E/S/G aspects, and at the level of individual risks;
- z accurate identification of areas for improvement based on the rating given to the way individual risks are managed;
- z facilitated completion of the questionnaire, characterised by multiple closed answers;

Poste Italiane's Vendor Rating (VR) system stems from the need to provide the Company with a system to measure the performance of suppliers and to evaluate them in the ESG sphere. This system represents an essential element of the supply chain, as it aims to define and implement a scoring model that allows for an accurate assessment of suppliers in relation to quality, safety, punctuality and environmental compliance of the services offered, as well as commercial behaviour and billing accuracy. The tool thus enables Poste Italiane to make informed choices on the purchase of goods and services. Through this system, all suppliers who carried out activities in the reporting period and were linked to Poste Italiane by contracts such as framework agreements and spot contracts were evaluated.

{275}------------------------------------------------

- z reliability and recognisability of the proposed methodology, based on internationally recognised studies that are affirmed best practices in relation to the area under analysis;
- z marketability of the proposed model by the Poste Italiane Group, which may consider making it a proprietary model and offering it on the market once it has been registered with the appropriate trademark.

With the aim of raising awareness among its suppliers and accompanying them on a path of sustainable growth, Poste Italiane is committed to the gradual introduction of environmental, social and governance criteria in its tendering procedures over the years. In this way, it is able to ensure a progressive expansion of the required scope, coverage and weight of ESG criteria on the tender score.

# Staff training and development

For Poste Italiane, human capital plays an extremely important role, as a distinctive element for the achievement of corporate objectives and an essential aspect for the creation of competitive advantage. Precisely for this reason, the Group promotes and invests in staff training courses that are able to prepare people to deal effectively with the demands of an ever-changing business. In particular, the role of training within the Company is a fundamental aspect of the process of continuous development of personal and professional skills, targeted at each person in the Group. With this in mind, Poste Italiane, through the adoption of innovative formats and knowledge sharing tools, is constantly striving to improve the learning experience in order to simplify access to training content and ensure continuity of learning.

The Company, in line with the Code of Ethics, expresses its willingness to recognise and value the importance of the individual contribution of each member of the Company's workforce, undertaking to guarantee equal opportunities in career paths to all employees, without distinction.

The Group considers training an essential lever for achieving competitive advantage in the market, constantly promoting its innovativeness and continuity

Consistent with the Strategic Plan, the training activities are part of a much broader project, which, in accordance with corporate principles and the needs of the market, customers and regulations, envisages the provision of around 25 million hours of training in the 2020-2024 five-year period. In order to promote the smooth running of training activities, in 2015, the Company established the Corporate University, identified as a Human Resources function that, through organisation in various Academies, delivers training on different business contents, depending on the skills to be developed. The Corporate University aims to define and guarantee the conduct of the training process in its entirety (including operational training). In particular, the "Training and Operational Training" Procedure, addressed to all corporate functions and all personnel, describes the Group's operational training model, explaining the operating mechanisms and organisational ownership of training and operational training activities. The logic guiding the Procedure is geared towards ensuring the effectiveness, efficiency and conformity of the expected results, through the introduction of organisational and control measures that are also relevant pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01. In addition, the procedure complements other more specific policies/ procedures for areas of activity/organisational functions that are being updated (e.g. funded training, BancoPosta training, etc.).

In 2022, the training plan focused on specific drivers identified with a view to promoting and accelerating the implementation of the Strategic Plan, in particular:

- z innovative content: push on digital skills development, multichannel, business development and new business;
#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

- z processes: re-focusing processes on the customer, by designing tools and solutions for simplification and streamlining;
- z skills and costs: continuous investment in staff skills, in line with the Plan objectives, and a continuous push on the recovery of funded training.

In 2022, the learning experience improved through the introduction of new innovative formats, such as the learning game mode, but also through the continuous updating of the e-learning platform, which allows simplified access to all training content, and the adoption of digital learning tools used for specific training objectives.

In addition, the use of the Open Learning Area content, freely accessible by the entire corporate population for on-demand use of the training offer, is confirmed. The learning area enables staff to choose their own training in a self-development perspective.

A total of approximately 6 million training hours were provided during 2022. In response to the various training needs related to the Group's different businesses, training courses were developed for specific targets (e.g. tellers, post officers and women, customer service employees, salespeople) for the acquisition, consolidation and development of the specialist technical skills of the related role. Cross-training courses were also provided on issues oriented towards the adoption of cultural tools and models addressed to all company personnel, regardless of their specific role. Finally, through individual training courses, especially dedicated to developing resources, skills useful for more complex roles were strengthened.

# 6 million hours of training in 2022

There were numerous free-participation initiatives dedicated to updating and acquiring digital and innovation skills. Among these, the "Digital Voices" programme saw voluntary participation in a rich cycle of webinars and online content with the aim of opening a window of observation on the external context, analysing the influence of digital on markets, to increase the predictive capacity required for the development of the Group's businesses.

Through the involvement of various organisational functions, the Corporate University represents the core of the training process and ensures the governance of the entire training process itself. This is organised in 5 Academies, each dedicated to specific skills. Three Academies focus on vertical business areas such as:the Commercial Finance and Customer Support Academy oversees the development of financial 

{281}------------------------------------------------

and insurance skills of the financial advisor and salesperson networks on the basis of sector regulations (ESMA/IVASS), as well as customer relationship skills; the Postal, Logistics and ICT Academy oversees the development of skills of the delivery and logistics network, as well as those of the ICT professional family; the Corporate and Faculty Academy, on the other hand, is dedicated to the development of skills linked to the professionalism of corporate functions, as well as managing Poste Italiane's internal teachers, ensuring their training and certification of skills. Also in the Faculty area, the internal teaching staff was enriched with a new trainer figure - the instructor trainer - to manage teaching in operational contexts. In addition, Poste Italiane's School of Coaches in 2022 expanded the number of new coaches engaged in the development of high-potential staff and in the support during the return to work of fragile resources, including young mothers. The other two Academies, on the other hand, focus on transversal core competencies. Specifically, the Managerial Academy oversees the development of managerial skills for senior roles, professionals and talents who will fill more complex roles, while the Digital Academy and Innovation ensures the design and development of online courses and the re-engineering of learning processes and tools.

Finally, there is a Planning and Governance function that deals with the consolidation of the training plan and the periodic monitoring and control of progress.

With the aim of exploiting the synergies of tools, methodologies and competencies, in May 2022, the Education initiative was merged into the Corporate University. Its objective is to promote campaigns, initiatives and opportunities for discussion aimed at stimulating dialogue with citizens and increasing customer confidence in products and services.

The training process starts with the annual Training Plan, which incorporates the training needs expressed by the lines consistent with the objectives of the Strategic Plan. Listening to and collecting training needs is, in fact, the first step in creating pathways and designing refresher, role-enhancing and skills-building interventions for the entire population, from new recruits to managers.

In addition, the HR Business Partner functions are also involved through the figures of the training contact persons and the resources working in cross-services in the Human Resources macro-area.

In order to verify the achievement of the set training objectives, the Group has implemented a monitoring and control system shared periodically with the business lines, which includes:

- z a general KPI system monitored on a monthly basis through the verification of:
	- hours of training provided (by function/area);
	- percentage of coverage;
	- value of perceived quality;
	- advancement of external costs;
	- recovery progress from Fondi;
- z a specific control system for the individual training initiatives that evaluates:
	- effectiveness, i.e. the ability to achieve the training objectives of the individual course through the pass rate of the end-of-course test;
	- participation rate;
- z specifically for compliance training, there are additional periodic reporting and monitoring systems for the control functions. In particular, on the progress of the training plan in terms of hours, participation, intervention backbones and trends, the Company has provided monitoring of utilisation for specific training campaigns being delivered.

In addition, the Company has provided for periodic audits by internal/external control functions (internal audits/certifying bodies/supervisory authorities) that assess the model adopted.

To support the monitoring system, Poste Italiane uses a number of additional tools such as surveys or focus groups in order to improve the design of the initiative and assess the effectiveness of the learners. The Company also pays close attention to the role of the media (the company website, Poste News, interviews on the TG Poste) in order to make potential employees aware of the importance of the training courses on offer. Finally, through long-term partnerships with leading business schools and suppliers, the Group has made available constantly updated training content that optimises the procurement process.

# 100%

of employees covered by People Analytics practices

For the improvement of systems, processes and strategies Poste Italiane, projected towards the achievement of sustainable business success, uses People Analytics, also known as HR Talent or workforce analytics, i.e. the practice of collecting and analysing organisational human resources data through the application of statistics and other data techniques. In particular, the Group used People Analytics practices in 2022 for the following purposes:

- a. strategic workforce planning through the collection of the needs of the various business lines combined with the management levers available (market recruitment, transformations from part-time to full-time, mobility flows, etc.) with the aim of defining the medium-term workforce frameworks consistent with the requests. The Group anticipates and guides workforce dynamics through People Analytics tools, considering in particular the use of incentive redundancies as a low-impact lever for controlling surpluses and directing prospective trends in resource deployment. People Analytics provides the possibility to analyse the impact of business projects and to identify and manage surpluses via "WebPers Pensionamento". This system makes it possible

{282}------------------------------------------------

to identify employees close to retirement and to manage the related exit process end-to-end, directly through the expulsion policy addressed to surplus organisational areas, while at the same time creating indirect redeployment spaces in different organisational areas, also according to the needs of the various business lines (e.g. counter, insourcing, etc.). Thanks to this tool, the Group managed the corporate reorganisation in advance and effectively and was able to guide the management dynamics to achieve business objectives;

- b. promotion through the Corporate University of a diversified training offer also through the analysis of a series of data (personal, organisational, of training assigned, used, completed and passed) in order to define, launch and monitor training courses for the development of basic skills (in the regulatory and general area), of related role (technical-specialist skills in the banking, insurance, postal-logistics, commercial and corporate compliance areas), aimed at specific segments of the population or even at individuals, from newly hired resources to managers. All data reside in an LMS platform and allow for constant analysis of training trends in terms of volume and impacted population, phenomena broken down by function and other dimensions of analysis;
- c. recruiting and hiring (e.g. evaluation of recruiting channels, candidate screening, talent supply/demand assessment) the data of which refer to external applications and are managed by several systems, in particular HCM Oracle, which is used to collect the information needed to start the candidate selection process;
- d. competitive Intelligence: through the HR Research Centre, which, as part of the Human Resources and Organisation function, aims to promote the alignment of professionals with market trends and best practices concerning the main processes that impact on human resources strategies, through the study, sharing and socialisation of new experiences and approaches. By way of example, the online Study Space was set up to analyse organised content and innovative solutions in the HR world, with a multidisciplinary and user-friendly approach, aimed at the contamination of knowledge and the emergence of innovative practices to be grafted onto functional strategies; in addition, contributions from the various business functions are proposed for the pooling of knowledge and the facilitation of implementation synergies with respect to corporate objectives, also with a view to achieving integration in the "people strategy" plans;
- e. analysis of the organisational network by understanding information flows, collaboration networks and informal exchanges between the various actors, in order to provide support for the re-engineering of organisational processes through the analysis of key relational dynamics. Organisational network analysis is also carried out by means of the Organisational Network Analysis methodology, which

makes it possible to graphically represent the networks of interaction between people in the Company. This methodology develops statistical and graphical models (maps) allowing for the study of the emergence of informal networks in the organisation, at the same time enabling the redesigning/restructuring of formalised organisational structures.

In addition, as part of its People Analytics practices, the Development function uses a series of additional data (personal, organisational, performance and potential data, etc.) for defining, monitoring and initiating people development and enhancement paths based on business objectives. The integration and analysis of such data provides a clear picture of employees with distinctive skills and performance, to be taken into account for possible access to evaluation programmes for potential or for possible activation of pathways to specific roles. In particular, POP (Process for Intercepting Potential Young People) and MLAB (Process for Intercepting Solid Professionals and Managers) are the Company's main scouting processes, which are managed with pre-defined access criteria (e.g. performance, company seniority) and allow the identification of eligible individuals. In both initiatives, it is possible to collect a specific amount of information on the potential that has emerged, with both qualitative and quantitative indications referring to the preservation of the Leadership Model's capabilities. In addition, as part of the HR Digital actions, an area of the Intranet called "Services for People" was set up, which outlines the services offered by the Company . The aim is to evolve the relationship model between employees and HR according to criteria of usability, simplicity, transparency and personalisation. To this end, the Group has implemented a pilot project for about 400 employees concerning an assistance tool available in the same area, through which the people involved can communicate with HR in a simple, transparent and fast way. This further innovation, the extension of which is being considered, will enable the systematic and constant collection of data useful not only for the type of requests and problems received, but also for the clarity of the services offered and the effectiveness of communication with Human Resources.

#### 2.893 million hours of training for compliance

As part of its training model, the Group always pays close attention to compulsory regulatory training, which refers to cross-cutting issues and is aimed at the entire company population (Safety at Work, Legislative Decree 231/01, GDPR, Integrated Quality and Corruption Prevention System, etc.) and specific training aimed at specific professional figures (e.g. ESMA/IVASS and Air Safety training).

{283}------------------------------------------------

#### Compliance training

#### Legislative Decree 231/2001

The online course "The Decree 231 in business ethics" continued to be delivered in 2022. It describes, through the stories of its protagonists, the general contents of Legislative Decree 231/2001 and the tools that Poste Italiane has adopted to comply with the principles and provisions of the Decree. The course falls within the scope of compulsory training and is therefore intended for all Poste Italiane Group staff. The training initiative illustrates general topics of Decree 231 that are also of interest to the Subsidiaries. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of each Subsidiary to assess any additional training needs in this area, taking into account the specific activities carried out by its employees and the operational and organisational peculiarities of the Company. Moreover, within the scope of the training initiatives promoted for the managerial roles of the Poste Italiane Group, the following training events on the topics of Legislative Decree 231/01 "The types of corruption offences" and "Market protection and corporate offences" were introduced.

#### GDPR

Since 2019, the Group has been delivering the online course "The GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation", which aims to provide an overview of the new features introduced and the obligations established by the General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679, focusing on the principle of accountability and the security measures that the data controller and data processor must take in order to ensure the protection of personal data. The course ends by outlining the relevant supervisory authorities, means of redress and sanctions in the event of a breach of the Regulation. The initiative is intended for all Poste Italiane Group staff, as part of the mandatory training programme. In addition, for the resources that have the role of Data Processing Delegate, of Compiler to support the delegate and their collaborators involved in the activity of keeping the processing register, the Company has organised training workshops on the subject of "Data Processing" delivered through webinars that provide an overview of the organisational and regulatory aspects of the GDPR, focusing in particular on the management of data processing, and aim to strengthen accountability and specific knowledge on the subject of personal data processing.

#### IT security

Like in previous years, the Group continued the delivery of the online course "Cyber Security", which illustrates the topic of cybersecurity, highlighting its importance in relation to the many aspects of professional life on which it can impact. The initiative is intended for all Poste Italiane Group staff.

#### Antitrust

Since May 2021, Poste Italiane has been delivering the training webinar "New Group Compliance Programmes - Integrated Compliance and Antitrust Compliance" aimed at the Group's management figures. In addition, since January 2022, the Company has started delivering the online course "Group Integrated Compliance", which promotes awareness of the guiding principles of the "Integrated Compliance Programme" adopted by Poste Italiane.

The course presents the main corporate regulatory tools through the analysis of the reference guidelines and contributes to the creation and dissemination of a corporate culture that is aware and attentive to the issue of compliance as a strategic objective and fundamental value of the Company. The training initiative is intended for resources working in the Group's central and territorial staff functions. Training continued with a further online course entitled "Compliance for competition and consumer protection" delivered for the same target group in February.

#### Anti-corruption

In continuity with the previous two-year period, training activities continued for all Poste Italiane Group personnel on anti-corruption, describing the integrated Quality and Anti-Corruption Management System that Poste Italiane has adopted, focusing on the provisions of the relevant regulations and, through the description and analysis of concrete cases, on the good practices to be followed to ensure quality and prevent corruption.

#### Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism

In 2022, the usual ESMA/IVASS induction and refresher training programmes were delivered in line with the financial and insurance industry regulations, with a particular focus on Anti-Money Laundering and Ethics. For the Group Anti-Money Laundering function, a professional course was delivered with the aim of further deepening the knowledge of the pillars of AML regulation.

{284}------------------------------------------------

#### Sustainability and corporate policies

In this area, the Group continued with the provision of two courses in 2022 in continuity with the previous two-year period:

"Business and Human Rights Protection", an online training programme open to all employees and aimed at promoting the knowledge and dissemination of the guiding principles adopted by the UN Human Rights Council. The course contents are produced and certified by SIOI (Italian Society for International Organisation), which can be taken through digital learning.

"Document Management", a course intended for all Poste Italiane Headquarters personnel, down to the third organisational levels, which describes the "Document Management" procedure, essential to ensure that Poste Italiane's Corporate Regulatory System achieves its objectives. The Regulatory System regulates both the reference principles, architecture and life cycle of regulatory documents and the roles and responsibilities of the various players involved in the document management process. It is therefore fundamental that these players, when drafting or updating company documents, know and apply the rules defined by the "Document Management" Procedure;

#### Transport safety and dangerous goods

The Group has organised "Air Security" training courses aimed at the resources involved in ensuring - for air freight - that security checks are carried out on cargo or mail in accordance with the regulations and in liaison with ENAC. In particular, they are made up of "Initial Training" and "Periodic Update Training" separated according to the activities/role performed.

In addition, in order to ensure the safety of employees driving HGVs, the Group organised "CQC - Carte Qualificazione Conducente" training for them. Again, the course consists of an "Initial Training" (CQC issue) and a subsequent "Periodic Update".

Finally, with a view to ensuring regulatory compliance of the services provided by Poste Italiane with regard to the transport of dangerous goods, the Company provided courses on "Dangerous Goods". Organised training is differentiated according to the mode of transport. For air transport, the "Dangerous Goods Regulation" course was delivered, a specific training activity to support resources in the proper handling of dangerous goods. With regard to road transport, on the other hand, the course "ADR: European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road" was organized.

In 2022, the Group promoted specific training activities for the managerial class, following three lines of action:

- z transversal initiatives: courses, pathways and formats for strengthening skills common to several professional groups;
- z target segment initiatives: courses and learning paths aimed at developing and strengthening the managerial skills of resources belonging to the same cluster;
- z initiatives by business segments: courses and courses designed vertically on specific business functions for the development of managerial skills related to business units.

In addition, webinar cycles were held to enhance managerial skills in the context of the guidelines of Poste Italiane's Business Plan and to compare them with the best practices of excellent national and international realities. There are both institutional pathways that accompany newly appointed managers in their new role for the development of competencies in an inter-functional perspective, fostering an exchange of value, both personal and professional, and training initiatives in support of the Diversity & Inclusion Plan aimed at developing skills related to the Corporate Leadership Model. In addition, the Group has implemented training measures aimed in particular at Executives, using innovative formats, to strengthen managerial skills capable of generating an acceleration in the ability to govern complexity.

{285}------------------------------------------------

#### Diversified skills development within the Poste Italiane Group

#### Mail, Parcels and Distribution

Training initiatives focus not only on skills upgrading and testing programmes based on IVASS and ESMA regulatory requirements, but also on the development of digital, innovation and change and complexity management skills. The Group also invested in important training projects, involving the commercial structures of the Private Market and the Corporate and Public Administration Market. In 2022, in line with the regulations of the financial and insurance sector involving the Commercial, Customer Service and internal trainers of the BP - Channel Product Support function, the usual ESMA/IVASS 60 and 30 hour induction and refresher training programmes were delivered; the mapping of development and training needs (annual assessment) was carried out for both the financial and insurance sectors, with particular focus on Anti-Money Laundering and Ethics. In December, the 30-hour ESMA tests valid for maintaining the ISO 22222 investment advisory service certification of MP's sales network were completed. The year saw the completion of the training course on aligning the specialised skills of the Financial Claims Management function in SAC, which will provide for an annual refresher course from 2023 onwards. In the area of Customer Operations, in particular in the area of Customer Service, training initiatives were carried out focusing on the importance of the relationship with the customer and the ability to interpret his needs, as well as on the evolution of the omnichannel value assistance model with a view to proactivity and addressing the MP sales network. In the Postal and Logistics area, training initiatives were carried out, in continuity with last year, to foster the orientation towards transformation through the dissemination of the Lean methodology as a cultural model and approach to work, as well as specific projects concerning postmen and women and other professional figures, thus also strengthening management and operational effectiveness. In particular, training courses were held for Quality Managers and Safety Specialists, with the aim of enhancing integration, proactivity and cross-functional relations. Finally, with specific reference to counter operators, the training activity on relational proactivity aimed at understanding customers' needs and seizing business opportunities in synergy with the sales network was completed. To further support technical expertise and with a view to continuous improvement, training initiatives were carried out on the Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) methodology and on the design of internal micro-logistics flows. In the area of Information & Communication Technology (ICT), numerous training activities were carried out to develop, strengthen and update specialised IT skills. Given the highly specialised and broad context of Information Technology, the acquisition of an ICT Catalogue of over 4,000 courses made it possible to cover the thematic macro-areas of interest, supporting the training of specifically qualified structures. For Group companies, we highlight the training initiatives implemented by SDA to pursue innovation and optimisation in order to meet future challenges related to new business, and the training activities carried out by Poste Air Cargo to maintain and develop the specific knowledge of flight and maintenance personnel.

#### Financial Services

The Group provided various training activities for the BancoPosta function aimed at learning and consolidating specialised skills and digital skills. During 2022, various initiatives were carried out to support the specialist figures dedicated to BancoPosta and BancoPosta Fondi SGR functions, aimed at supporting specific skills in the area of market scenario and evolution; ad hoc training measures, in line with regulatory provisions, were also carried out on Compliance and Anti-Money Laundering issues, in response to the mapping of skills carried out and aimed at targeting the training actions to support them. Finally, training activities were carried out at BancoPosta Fondi SGR in 2022 with the aim of strengthening skills in various areas such as:

- z mandatory regulatory: "Knowledge and Competence" course, "Relevant Personal Transactions" workshop (Market Abuse), "Group Business Continuity Management" training and anti-money laundering regulatory training;
- z technical specialisation: in-depth analysis of regulatory and civil law aspects applicable to AMC in the areas of taxation, inheritance, seizures, privacy; non-banking financial intermediary financial statements; advanced bank risk analysis; corporate credit analysis; financial markets-investment choices and uncertainty factors; the new outsourcing framework between Bank of Italy transposition of EBA guidelines and new ESMA guidelines on the cloud;
- z managerial: delivery of webinars with SDA Bocconi.

{286}------------------------------------------------

#### Insurance Services

The aim of the training for the Poste Vita Group (Poste Vita, PosteAssicura) was to update the skills of the various professionals. In particular, the updating of skills has concerned regulatory and compliance issues specific to the insurance sector (IVASS regulations, Legislative Decree 231/01, Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism, Quality and Anti-Corruption, GDPR Privacy, Information Security, Fraud Management, Occupational Safety, Sustainability and Company Policies, ISO 9001 and 37001, Data Quality, Business Continuity Plan, Company Regulatory System, Privacy-Processing Register). In addition, training initiatives were focused on specialised knowledge development topics (Actuarial training, Life and Non-Life insurance product updates, Innovation, Finance, ESG, Fintech, SQL Server standard training, insurance anti-fraud). Finally, in line with the previous year, ample space was reserved for the development of soft skills, new talent development and managerial skills.

#### Payments and Mobile

The training courses for Postepay continue to focus on cross-cutting topics, with a focus on digital, financial and professional effectiveness. The Group promoted the strengthening of skills in banking, service design and ICT. In order to support managerial development and the acquisition of skills on core issues for the Company, 24 "Executive Lab" courses and annual Master's courses with strategic and innovative content were provided, organised by the Luiss Business School, Fondazione CUOA and Scuola Palo Alto. Finally, for specialised training of particular relevance, the "EU Telecoms Regulation Master Programme" organised by the Cullen International SA School, which aims to provide a comprehensive overview of regulatory issues and developments in telecommunications in the sector; the "Master Program in Advanced Data Science and Quantitative Finance" organised by the ARPM School, which addresses topics related to quantitative risk management and portfolio construction. Lastly, in the field of Energy, we note the participation in the Milan SUMMIT organised by ARCHITECTA.

# Continuous performance improvement

The Group is committed to periodically monitoring the effectiveness, efficiency and quality of the training programmes provided, as these are key performance indicators of the training programmes. Effectiveness is measured by means of learning tests at the end of the training activities, while efficiency is identified as the ability to achieve the aforementioned objectives through consistent use of the available economic and organisational resources. Finally, quality is measured through questionnaires investigating the degree of employee satisfaction with the various levels and areas of the training offer.

# The development system

The Development, Change Management and Digital HR Function ensures the growth of the business through the valorisation of people, with a view to employee experience, capturing potential and talent, supporting motivation and enhancing experience. Specifically, the function accompanies the evolution of the Company's culture by promoting the change of mindset, behaviour and modus operandi of employees in a logic of diffuse leadership, whose main drivers are responsibility, integration and collaboration. Moreover, through an integrated system of development policies, programmes and tools, People Review and engagement processes, the Group favours an organisational culture focused on the person in all his or her expression, both personal and professional.

Each initiative is dedicated to heterogeneous target populations belonging to all corporate functions and all Group Companies. Particular attention is paid to ensuring equal opportunities in participation in terms of age, gender, functional and geographical affiliation, always taking into account the entry criteria specific to each initiative.

The Development System is built on the following 3 pillars that integrate an articulated set of processes, tools and methodologies:

- 1. scouting: allowing the differentiation of growth opportunities according to target audience and level of professional maturity. Scouting programmes contribute to enhancing talent through activities to detect and develop the potential of resources;
- 2. management planning: aimed at identifying development priorities with a view to succession and the reduction of "managerial risk";
- 3. development: to accompany people in their growth and expand the enhancement of skills in relation to company and business needs.

Consistent with the objective of enhancing business performance by attracting and developing talent, the Group's Development System can be seen from an employee experience perspective, favouring a culture that focuses on the individual and his or her needs.

All Development, Talent and Change Management initiatives are periodically communicated to the corporate population through the main internal (TG Poste, newsletter, corporate Intranet, etc.) and external (social media, specialised press) communication channels.

{287}------------------------------------------------

The objectives pursued in 2022, in continuity with previous years, were aimed at maximising the effectiveness of scouting and development programmes, expanding their capillarity and impact, including in terms of numbers, with a priority focus on business and the needs identified by internal customers. In addition, the establishment of the Development, Change Management and Digital HR function enabled the maximisation of integration between the scouting, development and People Review processes, as well as initiating a HR digitisation process within a broader HR and Organisation service evolution strategy.

The main drivers directing activities are as follows:

- z expand knowledge of people, their skills, potential and motivation, to support business functions in defining talent pipelines at various seniority levels;
- z consolidate People Review processes aimed at the shared identification of talents and the implementation of development paths dedicated to them;
- z greater impact on the corporate population through a more widespread use of development tools and their consolidation with a view to continuous improvement;
- z promote and systematise the use of relation-based development programmes, such as mentoring and coaching, as enablers for the enhancement of the skills needed for change management;
- z ensure equal opportunities in participation in development programmes, also considering the broadening of career prospects for women;
- z improve people's involvement and motivation through bottom-up processes of participation in initiatives with a strategic focus;
- z experiment with innovative tools for the promotion of new models of work, interaction and collaboration;
- z improve the knowledge of the initiatives activated and their impact on the organisation, through the activation of multiple channels and communication opportunities.

#### INSIEME 24 SI" platform

Poste Italiane, in order to consolidate its sustainable development strategy, launched in November 2021, "INSIEME 24 SI'", the platform for collecting ideas and contributions aimed at the entire Group population. It transversally involves the different areas of the Company's organisation, consistent with the objective of responsible growth and the process of digitalisation and social cohesion, promoting proactivity, innovating and creating shared value. In the context of Poste Italiane's Strategic Plan, "INSIEME 24 SI" represents a space in which the contribution of all stakeholders, as contributors, can be taken into account for the purposes of the Plan's implementation, fitting within the eight pillars of the sustainability strategy. The initiative is cyclical: the first edition, which ended in June 2022, saw in its main stages the participation of around 100 teams, comprising a total of 350 people, in an innovation marathon, the Bootcamp, during which the proposed ideas were discussed in greater depth and pitches presented to the jury of in-house managers. From the Bootcamp, 10 proposals were selected that followed an incubation path typical of start-ups: the teams, comprising a total of 56 people, working with the agile/sprint methodology and thanks to internal mentors and external tutors, produced a prototype that was presented to top management during the final event. These 10 prototype solutions, thanks to the sponsorship of business functions, are currently being consolidated and implemented so that they can become concrete projects capable of generating a positive impact inside and outside the Company.

The best three ideas further pursued the development of skills related to innovation and sustainability through participation in the training initiative "Entrepreneurial mindset & Launch your start-up", developed in collaboration with LUISS Business School. The experience, aimed at strengthening the entrepreneurial approach, allowed the participants to interface with the start-up eco-system in an immersive way, reflecting on possible internal barriers and facilitating the process of changing existing processes.

In September 2022, the 2nd edition was launched. Since the start of the programme, more than 1,300 ideas submitted by employees have been proposed and evaluated, and as of January 2023, 2,000 people are registered on the platform as contributors, putting their skills at the disposal of the Company and the ideas collected.

Both editions saw wide participation and engagement, also witnessed by the accesses to the intranet and campaign news (27,000 in the 1st edition, over 21,000 in the 2nd edition, until January 2023) and the "likes" receive during the "social" scoring of the ideas of the two waves (about 18,000 in both the 1st and 2nd editions).

{288}------------------------------------------------

With regard to people development and the promotion of professional development, the Group, in line with its work in previous years, digitally delivered scouting programmes to intercept potential and capabilities that could feed the talent pipeline at various organisational levels. The programmes are part of a digital structure that spans and supports all process steps. Ad hoc platforms allow optimal access from all devices, both fixed and mobile, thus increasing the efficiency of both dispensing times and the environmental impact of dispensing in terms of CO2 emissions and zero paper use.

These initiatives return information both with respect to the level of potential that has emerged and integrated quantitative and qualitative indications regarding the monitoring of the Leadership Model's capabilities, the orientation of participants and their motivation. These are:

- z POP: the process of identifying high potential young people with limited company seniority, that are inserted, according to predefined criteria, in a process of assessment and professional orientation, functional to growth towards managerial roles. The process is directed by internal Assessors certified for the digital management of the assessment and subsequent development sessions;
- z MLAB: the process of intercepting established professionals and managers, with consolidated experience in the role of manager to be developed on positions of greater complexity. This path has also been entirely redesigned in a digital perspective.

# 481

people involved in the POP and MLAB programmes in 2022

Following the assessment of potential, both programmes provide specific interventions to strengthen the profile of skills detected, which find in coaching a privileged support tool. In addition, managerial scouting processes, aimed at targeting rising middle managers towards roles of greater responsibility, were further expanded, providing for individual solutions alongside those of the Group. Both programs received a positive evaluation from the participants with respect to the level of usefulness, the degree of professionalism of the Assessors and the appreciation of the IT tools made available for use.

In addition to the scouting processes, the Leadership Assessment programme is aimed at senior managers, with a view to supporting executive development policies, designing career paths and succession plans. Consistently with the Diversity & Inclusion objectives that Poste Italiane has defined to support the 24SI strategy, the 2022 programme envisaged the priority involvement of female managers, mainly identified as potential 'successors' to positions of greater complexity. With this initiative, Poste Italiane proposes further support for the growth of leadership development skills.

With the aim of increasing the number of resources involved in the potential assessment processes, also involving populations not eligible for the scouting programmes already in place - POP, MLAB, Leadership Assessment - the significant investment in the use of smart potential assessment tools, usable online, continued and, thanks to the speed of delivery, allowed to involve +397% of people compared to 2021. In particular, this new approach was used in the People Review processes, for the valorisation of PCL postmen and, in MP, for the identification of Branch Operations Management Referents.

# +397% vs 2021

#### resources involved in massive scouting

The results of the potential, together with the performance trend and seniority, have guided the structured launch of the People Review, a Group talent enhancement process involving the business lines together with RUO in a cross-sectional comparison, aimed at bringing out a shared concept of talent within the organisation.

In 2022, the People Review involved PCL, DTO and Marketing. Line managers and HR managers met with a talent pool of about 700 resources to define accelerated development solutions and to expand the pipeline of candidates to fill business positions, also from a cross-Group perspective. In 2022, the Blooming Programme, a programme of development initiatives dedicated to personal 'blossoming', was launched for identified talent.

# +159%

presence of women in coachee activities compared to 2021

With regard to the introduction of innovative tools, in the area of skills development, the initiative SkillGym was confirmed, following the successful pilot test carried out in 2021. In 2022, more than 1,000 employees were involved in practising "critical conversations" to strengthen soft skills related to managing the feedback process, through the use of a digital platform that provides simulated environments guided by artificial intelligence.

Coaching activities were also enhanced in 2022, carried out by coaches both internally and externally, which involved managers and young talents in transversal skills enhancement courses. The number of coachees increased by 81% over the previous year, with a significant presence of women (+159% vs 2021). A specific programme was then launched - Mums at Work - which involves employees returning from maternity leave, accompanying them in their effective reintegration into the Company through dedicated coaching courses. The initiative is consistent with the Support for Active Parenting Policy, launched in 2022, which defines the Company's framework to support both women before and after motherhood and the 

{289}------------------------------------------------

evolution of the concept of shared parenting. An empowering asset within the Policy is the role of leaders and managers in creating an environment of trust and engagement for the expression of each employee's personal and professional abilities. In order to accompany the cultural and social paradigm shift, continuous dialogue, through anticipatory plans and time-structured moments, is an enabling lever to spread a growing awareness of the value of differences and inclusion. The Policy therefore introduced management and caring processes that offer a concrete response to male and female workers in innovative ways, approaches and perspectives.

Again with a view to enhancing the value of people in line with the talent expressed, expertise and results achieved, is the "Territorial Development Paths" project which, in continuity with 2021, has defined specific paths for key roles in the territory, through co-planning between central and territorial HR functions and Line, in an agile manner and capable of strengthening, at the same time, the development skills of the functions concerned.

# +47% female mentors compared to 2021

Market pressures and the continuous drive for change require people to become increasingly engaged and motivated, putting the concepts of responsibility, autonomy and flexibility at the forefront. In this context, Poste Italiane's mentoring programme has evolved, establishing itself as a stable and widespread process throughout the Company as a space of exchange for managerial best practices and different role models. In 2022, more than 440 mentors and mentees were active within the Company with a significant presence of women (+72% female mentees and +47% female mentors compared to 2021). Mentoring ensures the expansion of a global vision as it allows a comparison between diversity of gender, age and experience. Cross-fertilisation, i.e. transversality between functions and integration between centre and territory, is the main driver of the programme as it promotes mentorship relationships between managers and professionals from different areas and functions.

# +72%

#### female mentees compared to 2021

In connection with the 2022 Middle Managers evaluation campaign, the evaluation and feedback tools were further consolidated, with regard to a greater involvement of managers both in providing information on the development potential of employees and in being empowered, through a specific target, to be the main sponsors in their development. The roles of the team leader and team members were introduced into the evaluation process as additional providers of feedback on the performance of employees involved in cross-functional projects. This approach allows the direct manager to broaden the view of his or her staff and take this into account in the overall performance evaluation.

The use of the Oracle HCM Cloud Platform from 2021 allows integrated management of people evaluation and development processes. The platform made it possible to rethink the evaluation process as a pivotal process for people's development. Precisely because of the relevance and centrality of individual competence and performance development, the evaluation process is called the Performance Development Plan (PSP).

The PSP is based on conscious engagement and motivation of people, combined with a culture of results and collaboration. Achieving the goals of involvement and participation is contingent on making the links between organisational and individual goals clearer and more transparent, along with strengthening communication processes to make people more aware of their potential for development and growth and of their own role.

Feedback is a pivotal element of the PSP as a tool for growth and constructive confrontation that ensures continuous improvement leading to a feed-forward logic based on possible future improvement actions and solutions.

#### Corporate Mentoring of Poste Italiane

In line with the positive activities undertaken over the past three years, a new edition of Corporate Mentoring was launched in 2022, involving 81 aspiring mentors in a learning-oriented group coaching course. The Corporate Mentoring programme, coordinated by the Development and Performance Management function, is part of the personal development initiatives and aims to ensure a circularity of experience and leadership between company managers (Mentors) and employees (Mentees), through an exchange of values that is enhanced by the logic of inclusion and diversity in all its facets (generational, gender, territorial, cross-functional). The Mentoring relationship helps to reinforce the values and identity that the Poste Italiane Group wishes to express, as well as to ensure the successful accompaniment of the development of younger employees.

{290}------------------------------------------------

The design and implementation of development, talent management and change management programmes are managed by the central Development, Change Management and Digital HR function, which delivers the operational processes and monitors them across all functions and companies, providing regular information, data and feedback to all HRBP involved. With respect to the management, monitoring and governance of the data obtained, IT systems are exploited, and for some specific programmes, digital platforms belonging to HR partner suppliers are used (e.g. SAP, WEB PERS, MS Teams, Oracle HCM).

The results generated and the feedback gathered make it possible to assess the level of effectiveness of the development policies and criteria of the various initiatives. One of the goals of the Development, Change Management and Digital HR function is to ensure equal participation in terms of diversity through awareness-raising and careful monitoring.

After the initiatives, the Group carries out regular satisfaction surveys to assess their effectiveness.

In order to provide support to the teams and increase the level of engagement, Poste Italiane introduced in the Performance Development Plan the possibility of involving the project teams in the evaluation of performance, both during the assignment of goals (goal management) and in the actual evaluation phase. Contributing to the process in the manner outlined in the methodology are Project Managers, Organisational Contacts and cross-functional team members.

In order to enable a greater involvement of people, the implementation of a working model with greater individual responsibility and organisational integration and participation (bottom up, team) that goes beyond the traditional evaluation model (top down, leader-collaborator) was carried out for an initial target population. This provides:

- z self-assessment, with which to give an opinion on the achievement of goals and the skills implemented during the year, also for the purpose of further comparison during the feedback interview;
- z self-assignment of objectives, both operational and developmental, with the possibility of direct monitoring of the progress of the assigned objectives;
- z participation in the evaluation of employees and project leaders for members of cross-functional teams.

The rest of the corporate population, from 2021 onwards, saw the introduction in the PSP of ad hoc questionnaires for project information and scouting and people review processes, which allow individuals to express their interests, motivations, professional orientation and suggestions for improving integration and inclusion in work teams.

Taking into account the experience of the platform evaluation cycles, specific working tables were implemented for the design and implementation of evolutionary practices and for the simplification of the process, tools and system with the aim of increasing staff participation.

An important role within training is certainly covered by cross-training activities, which enable knowledge to be increased on topics common to several professional families, developing skills from an inter-functional perspective and fostering an exchange of value, both personal and professional.

A significant cross-cutting initiative, carried out during 2022 together with the Corporate Protection function, was dedicated to the topic of Eco-Driving. This activity is part of the actions implemented by Poste Italiane to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the air and raise awareness of environmentally sustainable driving.

The Corporate University also has two in-house Academies that focus on transversal core competencies, namely the Managerial Academy, which oversees the development of managerial competencies for senior roles, and the Digital Academy and Innovation, which ensures the design and development of online courses, the re-engineering of learning processes and tools, and scouts for innovative training solutions.

Digital is a cross-cutting area but it is vital to every activity in the Company. For this reason, several initiatives were carried out during 2022 to increase employees' skills in this area, such as the "Digital Voices" programme.

In addition, activities aimed at developing managerial skills related to the Business Units in Post, Communication and Logistics (PCL) continued with training on the Lean methodology (Lean Academy), while in the Private Market, courses were developed for Sales Managers and Operational Management Managers aimed at strengthening their roles following the revision of the territorial organisational model. In BancoPosta and in Mercato Business and Public Administration, "Team building" projects were carried out to foster knowledge and cooperation between the members of the Top Management of the respective functions.

Poste Italiane's "Insourcing and Re-employment " project provides for the redeployment of staff previously employed in other production sectors in new or strategic activities, fulfilling a social function of valorising people. The programme, designed to train and provide new skills with a view to professional growth and flexibility, was also dedicated to the re-employment of 'workers in a condition of fragility' within the meaning of current legal provisions who, unable to work on company premises in relation to health emergencies, found different employment to protect health and safety in the workplace. The re-employment of internal staff enables the in-house management of previously outsourced activities, with benefits both in terms of maximising productivity and saving on the profit and loss account, enabling the reduction of the use of external supplies. During 2022, 1,900 people were interviewed, of whom 1,252 were redeployed within the targeted functions/areas of re-employment through reskilling and training aimed at enrichment and acquisition of new knowledge. The programme was very successful among the employees.

#### Development programmes in the 2020-2021-2022 three-year period

The development programmes put in place in the 2020-2021-2022 three-year period resulted in benefits both in terms of containing the absenteeism rate and in a visible impact on the turnover rate for voluntary departures from the Company. The analysis of the target group involved in at least one development initiative in the last three years refers to diversified programmes and actions, such as:

- z scouting processes (MLAB; POP; Smart assessment, Talent Review, etc.) functional to bring out talented resources;
- z competence development initiatives (Coaching; Mentoring; Counselling, etc.) functional to accompany people in their growth and accelerate their development in relation to company and business needs;
- z engagement activities (INSIEME 24SI) and putting into play a self-entrepreneurial and innovative approach to contribute to the realisation of the Company's strategic objectives.

Generally speaking, development programmes not only enhance and consolidate participants' skills, but also offer benefits in terms of engagement, motivation and a sense of belonging.

In order to improve the working conditions of employees, Poste Italiane pays particular attention to active dialogue with the Company population. In light of this, the Group has effectively developed an internal communication channel, the NoidiPoste Community, which aims to generate, promote and implement constant interaction between all members of the Group, facilitating the sharing and management of information, enabling a wider dissemination of corporate culture, providing support for brand reputation and encouraging active participation in company dynamics by employees.

Confirming the validity of Poste Italiane's training offer, the Group obtained certification of its training processes in November 2021, valid until 2024 (UNI ISO 29993:2019). The certification came after the profound transformation of training processes through the revision of the organisational model of the Corporate University for Academy, the implementation of new tools and support systems, and the delivery of training almost exclusively by remote. This certification is important for the robustness and solidity of the implemented training model.

In October 2022, the annual surveillance audit was passed with no findings, which highlighted positively evaluated elements such as the constant adaptation of the training management process and its supporting processes with the implementation of meaningful monitoring indicators, and the strong push for innovation in digital processes from training needs analysis to user satisfaction.

# Staff welfare and well-being

The Company considers the well-being of its employees to be essential and for this reason is constantly striving to improve their conditions and those of their loved ones. In 2022, the Group increasingly considered responsibilities related to the care and well-being of people through actions aimed at consolidating the welfare system and spreading the corporate culture with initiatives for employees and their families. In addition, Poste Italiane pays increasing attention to aspects such as the personalisation of caring, reconciliation, the support and growth of the younger generations, the protection of the fragile and the strengthening of the sense of belonging and corporate identification

The needs of individuals, as well as the improvement of the conditions of the entire workforce, are at the heart of Poste Italiane's welfare strategy, and it is around these issues that initiatives are implemented every year to promote the wellbeing of each individual

Poste Italiane is committed to promoting activities that aim to improve the well-being of its employees, enabling easier living conditions and promoting better work performance. The initiatives are implemented in the process of strengthening staff engagement, as a prerequisite for the realisation of a positive corporate climate that ensures social well-being and productivity levels aligned with business objectives.

The implementation of the corporate welfare system is characterised by the adoption of an integral vision of the person, which goes beyond the work dimension, capable of taking charge of the individual's experience, also in the social, family and territorial dimensions, and by increasing attention to listening to and enhancing individual contributions in a logic of greater involvement towards common and shared objectives.

#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

With the aim of keeping welfare initiatives up-to-date, the Group adopts internal policies and specific procedures that aim to constantly recognise the emergence of new needs. In this regard, the Company uses company networks and dedicated working tables to develop benchmarks, while it makes use of internal and external questionnaires and surveys for employee satisfaction surveys. In addition, an intergenerational vision is adopted in the process of designing and developing the welfare plan, combined with targeted analyses of gender, age, professional characteristics, family situation and possible vulnerability of the people involved in the initiatives to support them throughout their life cycle.

The path taken by the Group has enabled it to gain experience and strengthen collaborative and cross-functional working methods characterised also by participatory models in bottom-up logic, because they enable a virtuous path in terms of identification, trust and a sense of belonging, which constitute an important link in the adequacy of welfare policies. This makes it possible to maximise, on the one hand, the qualitative and quantitative impact, in terms of the opportunities offered to people, and, on the other hand, it makes it possible to facilitate a faster implementation for the pooling of different competences and skills.

Thanks to the adoption of more and more timely and targeted welfare policies, it has been possible to identify certain behaviours that promote personal and organisational well-being:

- z disclosure: what the Company does for its people must be brought to the knowledge of the entire organisation, without intermediaries or cascading processes through the hierarchy;
- z proactivity: managers, the HR function and employees must be mutually active in order to foster the dissemination of values and plans that support people's well-being;

Poste Italiane, in its strategic business vision, aims to increasingly and constantly foster the integration of social and relational dimensions in order to improve its competitive positioning in the market. This has led the Company to play a primary role in a wider context than its business scope. The social vocation towards sustainable growth models, proximity to the territory, and the ability to establish a close bond with people has, therefore, led the Group to outline a new backbone of intervention towards community welfare logics, in synergy with local communities for corporate welfare services to support the vulnerabilities of employees and citizens.

The Company aims to make community welfare solutions and services available both to employees and their families and to local citizens, through forms of collaboration with the Third Sector and local authorities. The plan therefore envisages a reorientation of welfare services to make them usable for the community as well.

To this end, a design and feasibility study was launched in 2022 for the redevelopment of a company property located in Bologna, with the aim of creating meeting and socialisation places for people belonging to weak or vulnerable groups, such as the disabled, the elderly, unemployed young people, and women victims of violence.

{293}------------------------------------------------

- z proximity: solidarity mechanisms must be activated in the workplace that facilitate proximity and exchange relationships between people, including through horizontal collaboration models;
- z customisation: the identification of the most suitable levers, measures and solutions is shaped on the individual through listening and involvement;
- z dynamic adaptation: the solutions and responses identified at a given moment may not be the final ones, as people change and, often, the organisation does too. For this

reason, it is necessary to activate work adjustment mechanisms to ensure that proposals and solutions respond to the evolution of work situations, the relational and social context and the market.

Poste Italiane's objective is to introduce a corporate welfare system capable of neutralising inequalities and contrasts through the development of a circular, modular, interconnected and fair system that responsibly takes charge of people's well-being and collective balances.

#### Poste Italiane listens to its personnel

Survey "Poste Mondo Welfare": survey aimed at non-executive employees of the Parent Company and the Group Companies participating in the programme to detect the satisfaction of the participants in the plan to convert the result bonus into welfare and to incorporate the needs of the entire company population for the launch of the edition referring to the year 2022. In particular, the activity consists of a series of surveys aimed at programme members to detect their enjoyment of the experience of the various services and their prospective needs, and at the entire corporate population to increase the level of engagement and participation on the value of the programme in relation to the launch of the annual edition as well as the better setting of the offer in relation to the real needs of the corporate population. The rating scale on which the survey was based provided values from 1 to 10.

2022 Home-Work Mobility Survey: annual survey that analyses employees' home-work travel habits in order to identify, in the medium and long term, sustainable mobility solutions to reduce CO2 emissions in the interests of employees and the community. The survey was conducted using CAWI methodology and featured multiple-choice questions, radio buttons and open fields.

New Intranet Survey: survey aimed at co-designing the content of the new "NoidiPoste" intranet. The survey was conducted using CAWI methodology and featured multiple-choice questions, radio buttons and open fields.

"Call to Action" Survey: fact-finding survey addressed to Internal Workers and Production workers (profiled) to acquire the orientation of the personnel affected by the reorganisation with respect to the various relocation options, as defined by the trade union agreement of 2 August 2022.

"Dicci la tua su Poste Energia" Survey: : listening survey on "Energia160", the PosteEnergia electricity and gas offer reserved to employees.

New Newsletter Survey: questionnaire on the new format of the weekly internal communication newsletter. The survey was carried out with Microsoft Forms and featured multiple-choice questions, radio buttons and open fields.

"PosteIn – Diversity & Inclusion secondo te" Survey: survey of the entire company population with the aim of understanding how Poste Italiane's commitment to Diversity & Inclusion issues is perceived by employees. The survey was carried out in cooperation with online administration and dissemination through the company intranet, official news, TG and newsletters.

"Progetto di ricerca con Polimi" Survey: the survey, launched in June 2022, is part of the research project conducted by the Politecnico di Milano to build an interpretative model on employee engagement/disengagement with respect to set variables. The target group was approximately 11,000 people representatives of the main corporate functions. The project envisaged the administration of the survey at two different times approximately one year apart.

The analysis of the results of the first survey was completed in 2022, and the second one is planned for the first half of 2023. The survey was structured with a set of questions attributable to the following clusters:

- z level of well-being;
- z working in Poste Italiane;
- z leadership in Poste Italiane.

"DDay Poste Plurale, Universale" Survey: feedback questionnaire conducted anonymously among employees who participated in the corporate event Diversity & Inclusion day with testimonies from employees and external guests on the topics of gender, generations, vulnerability, interculturality to collect satisfaction and programmatic ideas for the next editions of the initiative.

{294}------------------------------------------------

By intensifying its internal communication activities, Poste Italiane Group, through innovative projects and methodologies, has been able to strengthen the dialogue with its employees and achieve multiple international recognition. In this regard, in 2022 the Company continued to publish in the innovative Postenews app, launched last year, with the aim of reporting daily news with features and video reports from

# 49

#### editions of Postenews in 2022

inside and outside the Group. The Poste Italiane magazine, therefore, offers updates on topics related to logistics, savings, the economy, institutions, security, welfare, the environment and digital. TG Poste, on the other hand, was created in response to the Group's need to continue its mission of being close to its employees on information issues too, providing the most important news, and to tell the outside world about the Group's business inspired by the principles of sustainability and customer focus. TG Poste is broadcast every day, Monday to Friday, and is streamed live on the Poste.it website and on screens in Post Offices, as well as being visible on demand at tgposte.poste.it and for employees also from the company intranet or the NoidiPoste app. .

# Work-life balance

With regard to the Group's welfare strategy, the Company pursues the improvement of its employees' well-being by seeking a work-life balance. In line with previous years, Poste Italiane has provided orientation paths for young people and support for families, strengthening the focus on the social and family dimension of workers, also to support parenthood.

In the area of contractual welfare, the Poste Mondo Welfare programme was launched for the fourth consecutive year, implementing the trade union agreement on the performance related bonus, which allows employees, on a voluntary basis, to convert all or part of the performance bonus in

welfare goods and services characterised by specific social, educational, recreational and welfare purposes. The programme provides tax benefits related to current legislation and additional company welfare credits to increase the purchasing power of employees and their families. In this regard, the welfare platform has been revamped to make it simpler and more intuitive to use, and has received - also using the listening survey published on the NoidiPoste intranet - feedback from both the previous year's subscribers and those who had not yet undertaken this experience. In 2022, Poste Mondo Welfare was characterised by an improvement in the employee experience, a widespread and multi-channel internal communication plan, information workshops, dedicated ambassadors, travelling promotional stands in the most staff-intensive organisational structures, and an expansion of the network of goods and services offered to promote greater awareness of the related opportunities. In addition, the benefits of the tax legislation in force were valorised, with specific reward measures relating to the recognition of additional fuel vouchers - based on the percentage of membership and use of the programme - and the reimbursement of household bills for electricity, water and gas. During the year, platform members were able to benefit from an increased economic value compared to the previous year. The programme has been so well received by the employees that it has more than doubled its membership rate compared to past editions.

sign-ups to the Poste Mondo Welfare program compared to 2021

For many years, the Company has identified part-time work as a valid instrument of labour flexibility that enables it to meet the individual work-life balance interests of employees with the organisational needs of the Company, and provides economic incentives for workers' requests to transform fulltime employment into part-time work.

In addition, on the occasion of the renewal of the relevant CCNL, signed on 23 June 2021, regulations were introduced for the presentation of requests for the transformation from full-time to part-time by the workers concerned, providing for the possibility of formulating the request every six months and with reference to the specific time slots (so-called clusters) made known, from time to time, by the Company.

Employee support programmes

{295}------------------------------------------------

#### Poste Italiane and its continuous support for parents

An important role within the Company is attributed to professionals who are parents in their private lives, for whom initiatives, policies and support services are put in place to support and reconcile private and working life.

One example is the Company's decision to launch the Support for Active Parenting Policy in 2022, in order to support the role of parents and enhance gender balance, overcoming stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice in the workplace.

Poste Italiane provides crèches at its Rome and Bologna offices for the children/grandchildren of Group employees and, for a portion, for users from municipal and third-party entities as a subsidiary response to the needs of local users. The service is extended to more than 100 families with children from 3 to 36 months and an employee contribution from the Company of 55% of the value of the monthly fee is provided. The objective is to guarantee a flexible educational service in relation to work pace, to combine professionalism and quality in respect of the values expressed by families. The distinctiveness of the educational programme is represented by an integrated relational approach on the part of all the players involved in the process, by attention to the values of environmental sustainability (such as the use of at least 50% organic, PDO and PGI and 0 km food), by cross-culturalism (bilingualism) and by inclusion and educational alliance with families to foster a structured dialogue, also through innovative communication methods. These include new opportunities for exchange and participation, such as the interactive app, new seminar programmes to support parenting, thematic webinars extended to all employees, and a counselling service as a listening and reflection space offered to parents to explore any difficulties related to their children's developmental processes and transition phases.

To strengthen the initiatives in support of active parenthood, in line with previous years, the Company continued the Lifeed project, a digital platform active since 2015 formerly known as MAAM, and activate the MultiMe®Finder programme, in order to improve awareness of the roles played in different life experiences.

On the Group's 160th anniversary, Poste Italiane promoted the "IlNostroXcorso" project, with the aim of rediscovering Italian localities by travelling mainly by bicycle, the mean of transport symbolically linked to the postman's work. Through an application available on the NoidiPoste app and intranet, users had the opportunity to share their travel experience undertaken alone or in company, running, walking, or using a bicycle, starting from their home, place of work or a place they considered important. With this initiative, the Group wants to introduce the people of a large Company, spreaded across many parts of Italy, inclusive, attentive to environmental sustainability and united in teamwork to achieve increasingly challenging goals, in pursuit of the well-being of all.

# Health and prevention

With reference to initiatives aimed at fostering primary prevention and the maturation of social awareness in young people, Poste Italiane organised, in collaboration with the Veronesi Foundation, a series of informative meetings aimed at employees and their families on issues related to ethics, healthy lifestyles and scientific disclosure with content proposed from an intergenerational perspective.

In line with previous years, in order to guarantee the health of staff and the protection of the environment, post officers have been provided with uniforms bearing the green OEKO - TEX Standard 100 certification, which ensures that the

#### "Poste Centro Medico"

Poste Italiane's healthcare facility for its People

With 11,000 health services in two years, Poste Centro Medico consolidates its role as a safeguard of the well-being of employees and their families.

In 2022 the activities of Poste Centro Medico, the centre of excellence dedicated to the care and prevention of Poste Italiane employees, their families and pensioners continued, with the aim of strengthening the well-being of employees in the workplace by offering medical services and preventive healthcare. The Outpatient Clinic is coordinated by a Clinical and Healthcare Director and brings together a significant number of professionals working in the most important national healthcare facilities.

Poste Centro Medico offers qualified services and provides specialist examinations, instrumental and ultrasound examinations in 13 medical areas, as well as diagnostic imaging and other medical services. The Centro Medico is also equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment (state-ofthe-art ultrasound scanners, videodermatoscope, gynaecological unit, ophthalmic equipment, etc.). In particular, in 2022, Poste Centro Medico expanded its range of services: one example is the introduction in May 2022, of equipment to also perform mammography for the early diagnosis of breast cancer.

{296}------------------------------------------------

product is carefully checked for ecological and health aspects. With regard to the PDA given to post officers, on the other hand, over the years, Poste Italiane has developed a new feature that allows a voluntary request for help to be sent in the event of the need for medical intervention. In this way, the device used by post officers also becomes a tool to increase safety at work through certain functions, such as the SOS function that allows, in the event of an emergency, to activate a call to the so-called "Situation Room" where a team of operators is ready to respond to distress calls. In addition, before leaving for the delivery, a reminder function is activated on the smartphone reminding the post officer of the protective equipment he must always have, such as a jacket or high-visibility waistcoat. Finally, twice a month, a pop-up reminds the postman to check the maintenance status of the vehicle and to report any service requests.

# Culture and education

Poste Italiane reinforces the Company's commitment to the development of the new generations with the desire to contribute to the growth of young people through numerous initiatives for school and professional orientation and the development of soft skills for the children of employees and for young people also from vulnerable social backgrounds.

scholarships for employees' deserving children

In fact, in continuity with past editions, the Group has implemented the "Next Generation" project dedicated to the employees' children and children from secondary schools in fragile territories. The programme aims to introduce young people to issues of innovation, diversity and social inclusion and to the professions of the future. In this regard, the following were realised: skills development workshops, orientation meetings in which the students also learnt how to write an effective CV and how to prepare themselves for interviews, the "Digital Creathon" with the launch of the corporate challenge and the Innovation hub. During the "Digital Creathon", the participating young people - students from schools and children of Poste Italiane employees - were able to get involved in responding to the challenge launched by Poste Italiane: "Oltre l'apparenza" (Beyond Appearance). The challenge was also degigned in line with the UN Agenda 2030 and the 10th Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, "to reduce inequalities" and thus to empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, regardless of all forms of diversity. Hence, the idea to ask

them to make a presentation and a video that, starting from their family, school and social experiences, would tell stories of marginalisation and separation and also show the way to overcome them, going "beyond appearances" and valuing each person and path.

Poste Italiane took part in the two-year "School4Life 2.0" project, discussed in detail in the previous chapters, and in the new editions of the STEAMcamp initiative, dedicated to the employees' children and their families with the aim of deepening their knowledge of STEAM subjects. STEAMcamps are able to promote innovation and the distinctive skills needed for future professions through a learning and gaming experience that stimulates confrontation with new models ranging from coding, artificial intelligence, gamification, robotics and more, whose only boundary is creativity. In 2022, new awareness-raising proposals called "Social Media Lab" were launched, focusing on the language of digital innovation, to help young people understand the evolution of identity on the Internet and to raise their awareness of online sociality.

In addition, the "Future Lab" programme for employees' children has also been strengthened with the new editions, with the aim of fostering their integration into the world of work, stimulating reflection on their personal development plan on the ability to design a study and career path. Specifically, the programme aims to bring young people closer to the world of work in a more conscious way, supporting them in their choices so that they can pursue paths in line with their skills and passions and learn about the main market trends on the professions of the future.

Finally, with a view to promoting cross-cultural exchanges, 19 scholarships abroad were awarded to deserving children of employees, supported entirely by the Company.

# Sense of belonging

As part of the initiatives aimed at consolidating the sense of belonging, 58 Group employees were awarded the "Stella al merito del lavoro" (Star of Labour Merit) in 2022 for distinguishing themselves by virtue of their particular expertise and industriousness in their work for the Company. Stars of Merit are awarded annually to workers employed by public and private companies, who are at least 50 years old and have worked continuously for at least 25 years. Half the honours are reserved for those who started from the lowest contractual levels and have distinguished themselves for their human and professional contribution to the Company. Specifically, employees were identified throughout the country and are representative of most of the professions in the Company. The honour carries the title "Maestro del Lavoro" (Master of Labour) and is conferred by Decree of the President of the Republic, upon proposal of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.

# Relations with social partners

Poste Italiane, through periodic meetings with the Trade Unions (OO.SS.), maintains constant dialogue with workers' representatives, not only with regard to ordinary management but also in the event of major organisational changes, with the aim of placing the well-being and protection of workers' rights at the centre. Therefore, it concludes agreements governed by the National Collective Labour Agreement (CCNL) and the Consolidated Text on Representation to facilitate the creation of a positive corporate climate and ensure compliance with the applicable regulations. The Group implements every activity envisaged by the Industrial Relations System, described in Chapter I of the CCNL of Poste Italiane SpA (Information, Consultation, Participation, Bargaining), also in order to accompany the actions envisaged in the Company and Group Strategic Plan. In this way, the Company ensures appropriate and fair solutions on issues that can have significant impacts not only on the organisation and the business, but also and above all on human capital, which is considered a fundamental asset.

Consistently with the requirements of current legislation, Poste Italiane ensures impartiality and independence in its relations with Trade Unions, as set out in the Group's Code of Ethics, and at the same time, undertakes to ensure the well-being and protection of the rights of its workers and their freedom of association and collective bargaining.

- z Parental leave: more favourable treatment than that provided for by law (art. 43 National Collective Labour Contract);
- z Healthcare: the Company provides a supplementary healthcare plan with a contribution paid by the Company for the "Basic" package (art. 79 National Collective Labour Contract);
- z Pension: payment of contribution to the FondoPoste by the Company (art. 79 National Collective Labour Contract).

# Non-financial benefits

To complete the remuneration package, Poste Italiane Group provides executives and certain types of managers with additional non-financial benefits, in compliance with applicable regulations and taking account of market practices. These benefits are subject to specific guidelines, which require the application of common criteria depending on the uniform category of employee concerned. Examples of non-financial benefits attributed to executives are the company car for mixed use and the medical check-up, also provided for facility managers.

#### MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

NFS

Poste Italiane is committed to ensuring the welfare and protection of its employees, who are at the heart of its strategy, and maintains constant dialogue with the social partners

Poste Italiane refers to the national collective bargaining, which provides for a specific procedure of discussion between the Company and the national Trade Unions stipulating the CCNL in the event that significant organisational changes (such as company reorganisation and/or restructuring and/or transformation processes) entail social consequences, with repercussions on working conditions.

100%

of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements

{298}------------------------------------------------

In this regard, the Group is required to provide prior information to the National Trade Unions stipulating the CCNL, indicating the date of the start of the discussion, in order to seek possible solutions to manage the social effects. The negotiations shall be completed no later than 25 working days, including Saturdays, following the date set by the Company for the first meeting. During this period, the Trade Unions must refrain from any direct action, while the Company cannot implement the planned projects. After 25 days, if the outcome of the discussion is negative, the Parties may make their own autonomous decisions; in the event of a positive outcome, on the other hand, the Company shall provide adequate information to the competent territorial structures of the Trade Unions. Prior to the start of discussions at the territorial level, the RSUs (Unitary Labour Union Representatives) must be consulted, a phase which must be completed no later than 13 working days, including Saturdays, from the date on which the hypothesis of agreement was signed. Subsequently, the Parties shall meet at a territorial (regional) level to carry out a joint examination, to be concluded within 7 working days, including Saturdays, following the end of the consultation of the RSUs.

The continuous dialogue and constructive relationship between the Company and the Social Partners represents a characterising and significant element in the Group's growth and evolution strategy. Continuous dialogue with the Trade Unions is ensured through significant information and negotiation activities with the Social Partners conducted by the Industrial Relations function. The most significant outputs of this activity are represented by the signing of specific agreements with the Trade Union Organizations both on the subjects expressly indicated by the National Collective Labour Agreement of 23 June 2021 (CCNL), and on further topics relating to the achievement of the Plan objectives that have regulatory and/or managerial effects on personnel.

# The National Collective Labour Agreement

With the aim of pursuing the well-being of employees and guaranteeing the protection of their rights, both during ordinary management and in phases of change in the Company's organisation, Poste Italiane considers dialogue with employee representatives to be a central aspect of the Group's organisation and management. Therefore, the Company is committed to a constant dialogue with the Trade Union Organisations (OO.SS.), guaranteeing impartiality and independence in the promotion of relations in compliance with current legislation and ensuring, at the same time, the protection of rights, freedom of association and collective bargaining.

In this regard, in 2021 the Group renewed the National Collective Labour Agreement (CCNL), valid until 31 December 2023. The Agreement, which introduced important improvements both in the economic area and in the organisation's regulatory framework, covers the entire non-managerial staff of the Poste Italiane Group and strengthens the focus on the defence of workers' rights, their security and economic stability. The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility is a fundamental principle for the Company, through which it is possible to combine the Group's development objectives and economic results with the respect for social and environmental values, enhancing the continuous and constant contribution of human resources.

# Active labour policies

In line with previous years, Poste Italiane signed agreements on labour policies, realizing its commitment to relations aimed at the welfare and protection of workers' rights.

With the Agreement signed on 8 February 2022, the Parties, before identifying the overall active policy measures to be implemented for the year 2022, defined an extraordinary measure, of an anticipatory nature, for a total of 1,100 FTE (Full Time Equivalent) between counters and placements from the external market, in order to support the needs of frontend structures in the most critical territories. The Agreement signed on 12 May 2022, also in order to support the reorganisation actions already shared and the further organisational review actions discussed in detail with the Trade Unions, provides that, for the three-year period 2021-2023 - in line with what was defined in the Agreement of 13 June 2018 - the Company will ensure an adequate number of Active Employment Policies actions in relation to the incentive-based redundancies that will be recorded in the period. Specifically, Active Employment Policies (stabilisations, conversions from part-time to full-time, recruitment from the external market, counters, job postings) were implemented for a total of over

6,900 FTE. On 6 September 2022, the Parties agreed that for 2022, by way of exception, the limit on the use of fixed-term contracts in the regions of Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Liguria, Valle d'Aosta, Marche, Campania and Calabria is set at 12%. In the Understanding of 21 November 2022, the Company and Trade Unions agreed on an advance of the Active Labour Policy 2023 for Post, Communication and Logistics (PCL) by defining strengthening actions both in delivery (700 full-time availabilities) and sorting (60 conversions from part-time to full-time). Similarly, on 19 December 2022, Active Labour Policies interventions were agreed, again in anticipation, in relation to the Private Market, to be implemented starting from January 2023. In particular: conversion from part-time to full-time for 350 Counter Operators (175 FTE), transfer to front-end roles of 225 postmen and women eligible for job posting under the Agreement of 12 May 2022 (counters) and 250 recruitments from the external market to fill specialist roles. In the Agreement of 1 February 2023, the Parties agreed on the need to evaluate, within the framework and subsequent employment agreements for the year 2023, dedicated measures for the Digital, Technology & Operations function.

{299}------------------------------------------------

On 2 March 2023, an Agreement Report on Voluntary Mobility (transfers on request) was signed whereby, pending the definition of the new agreement that will regulate the matter for the years 2023/2024, the Parties acknowledge that any transfers - both at national and regional and provincial level - will be carried out taking as a reference the 2022 rankings drawn up on the basis of the Agreement of 4 May 2021, which expired on 31/12/2022.

With the Agreement of 1 February 2023, the Company and the Trade Unions defined, with regard to "Back Office Services", a rationalisation and a new micro-organisation of the Territorial Depots through a reduction in the number of sites (from 10 to 5) and the elimination, in the course of 2023, of the Depots in Bari, Bologna, Genoa, Padua and Turin. The related employment effects will be dealt with progressively when the individual depots are closed. In addition, a Planning and Operational Control Specialist role was introduced to support the Depot Manager. A new credit management model was presented, characterised by dedicated supervision and a single interface with the customer, to reduce overdue loans and make the whole process more efficient. The new model will be subject to a trial with the parties committing to meet no later than May 2023 to review its progress. A number of actions were also defined to merge and relocate sites of the Territorial Centres, with the aim of optimising processing and consolidating the supervision of document management services through the establishment of a single facility for the sites in the same city. The resources concerned will continue to perform the same activities and, where the conditions are met, they will be granted the benefits provided for in Article 38 of the current CCNL. In relation to the services of"Customer Assistance", the Company presented the Value Assistance service that will provide support in the purchasing phase of products/services and interact with customers through sales proposition initiatives. The introduction of this new service will be accompanied by dedicated training courses for the staff involved. With regard to Information Technology services, and especially with reference to the Technology Poles, the operational model and the micro-organisation model were redefined, also through the introduction of specific support figures for the territorial technical structures. Field Technical Services were introduced with the aim of ensuring a better coordination of technical support interventions and offering a quick response to business structures. Finally, as of March 2023, the remodelled timetables according to the new organisation of the Technology Centres will come into force, characterised by a single nationwide model with a Saturday presence as well. The parties agreed on the need for specific meetings at regional and national level to best accompany the reorganisation processes of the Digital, Technology & Operations function.

With the Agreement Report signed between the Company and the Trade Unions on 12 May 2022, the process of organisational revision of the Private Market function initiated with the Agreement of 30 September 2021, and which had focused on strengthening the business model, continued. With this latest agreement, the Company and the Trade Unions implemented further organisational reviews of both the business model and the operational platform of the sales support functions. Specifically, the number of the Protection and Financing Contact Persons was increased and the relational activities carried out by the Reception Workers were developed. The Agreement also provided for the strengthening of the Corner 2.0 network, which evolved into the "Punto Poste Casa e Famiglia" format. The territorial operational management model was updated by enhancing the coordination, support and control activities at the Macro Area level and streamlining the structure at the Branch level. Finally, new momentum was given to the Hub & Spoke project, with the release, on a trial basis, of the new posting application, which will be adopted by the Hub DUP on the first six branches starting from June. On 19 December 2022, the Company and Trade Unions signed an agreement covering three macro topics: 1. the Polis Project - House of Digital Services; 2. the evolution of the organisational model Small Economic Operators (POE); 3. the anticipation of the Active Employment Policies 2023 measure. The Polis Project involves about 7,000 Post Offices, located in municipalities with a population of less than 15,000 inhabitants, which will be reconfigured to enable the provision of a wide range of PA services, as well as the creation of co-working spaces in an interconnected national network of 250 properties. The evolution of the POE organisational model, on the other hand, envisages the reconfiguration of the Mercato Privati sales chain from a synergic perspective, placing the POE channel alongside the retail channel. In particular, at the Macro Area level, the role of POE Sales Representative was created and the role of the Enterprise Sales Manager was superseded, with the relocation of resources within the Private Market or Enterprise Market and Public Administration functions. At the branch level, the Small Business Specialists (SSB) and Mail and Parcel Specialists (SPP) were moved to report to the Branch Sales Manager (RCF).

On 1 March 2022, the Company signed an Agreement with the Trade Unions, in force until 31 March 2023, which regulates the application of agile working in Poste Italiane and in the Group Companies applying the National Collective Labour Agreement (CCNL), renewed on 23 June 2021. The Agreement, in tracing the regulatory framework of the previous 2020 Agreement - which, among other things, provided for the possibility for all employees to activate agile working for a maximum of 3 days per week and 13 days per month - introduced some new elements that make it consistent not only with the National Protocol on agile working stipulated by the Social Partners on 7 December 2021, but also with the organisational and management evidence that emerged from the observation of the implementation phase of the Institute in the Company during the emergency period. Specifically:

- z some organisational areas/figures previously affected by agile working (e.g. Sorting Centres, Operations Centres, Premium Referrers, etc.) were reduced;
- z for managers and for specific professional figures, the need to guarantee in-presence supervision of activities and coordination of resources has been emphasised, with the possibility of flexible use of the Institute during the month, without reference to any single week;

{300}------------------------------------------------

- z the provision contained in the 2020 Agreement that provided for the sterilisation of unrecognised injury events for the purposes of accounting for the performance bonus and voluntary national mobility was eliminated, bringing the case back to the normal management of absences due to injury/sickness;
- z a specific Joint Observatory was set up with the task of monitoring the implementation phase of the Institute.

On 8 June 2022, on the basis of the provisions of the Agreement dated 1 March 2022, the Joint Observatory on agile working met and carried out an initial survey on its implementation in the Company. The Trade Unions emphasised the need to study certain issues in greater depth, including, by way of example, reasonable accommodation, fragile workers, etc. The need to provide for agile working for training purposes for all workers whose work cannot be remotely performed was also emphasised. The Agreement Report signed on 3 August 2022, taking into account the epidemiological crisis from Covid-19, extended the possibility of smart working to staff hired on a temporary basis as well as, for training purposes only, to CTD staff at operational facilities.

Agile working is a useful tool for the Company to optimise the organisation and use of resources in a way that is more respectful of environmental sustainability and collective well-being, by limiting home-work journeys, reducing traffic and cutting emissions. Moreover, this working mode is also considered a welfare tool, as it allows not only to combine personal and family needs with professional ones, but also to protect employees who are in particularly fragile conditions, safeguarding the Company's production and quality standards. On 2 March 2023, the Agreement was signed by which the Parties agreed to extend the effects of the agreements of 1 March and 3 August 2022 until 30 September.

On 29 July 2022, the Agreement on performance-related bonus for 2022 was signed for Poste Italiane SpA and the Group Companies. With reference to the unit value of the bonus, the agreement provided for a 5% increase, allowing for a recovery of the inflationary pressure resulting from the overall economic/monetary trend. With respect to the national indicators which the payment of the bonus is correlated to, Group revenues per employee were introduced for Poste Italiane. Moreover, in order to further enhance the importance of the professional contribution of individual resources to the achievement of company results, a bonus (an additional €50 to the individual value of the Bonus) was introduced for employees who did not take any leave of absence in the year of reference, and the incidence of sickness events on the determination of the sum to be paid as a performance bonus to each worker in June 2023 was also revised. In addition, the possibility of converting all or part of the bonus into welfare has been confirmed, simplifying and making more advantageous the mechanism of credit recognition by the company against the converted amount.

With the Agreement of 2 August 2022, the Parties outlined the organisational and management guidelines under which the organisational revision processes of some important production areas of the Post, Communication and Logistics (PCL) function will be implemented. Specifically, the Understanding provides for:

- z the evolution of Internal Processing activities, which are brought back into the organisational framework of sorting at 150 Centralised Centres;
- z the definition of new working hours for the resources employed in the sector;
- z the updating of postmen's entry times as a result of the new timing and feeding methods of the Distribution Centres (CDs).

In addition, the staff members Market articulation were also called upon to perform activities at the centralised nodes (so-called residual activities on CDs). This move defined the new needs of the sector and, with respect to the management of the employment effects generated by the project, the levers to be activated were identified in order to achieve the correct workforce size (redeployment at centralised nodes, professional enhancement/mobility in different organisational areas, retraining courses, redeployment within the Insourcing project, voluntary redundancies based on incentives, possible activation of the Solidarity Fund). The Parties, in defining the macro-frameworks of intervention, agreed to postpone to a further Agreement the identification of the detailed rules aimed at regulating all the application aspects of the project, including the criteria for the relocation of resources. The new model was applied on an experimental basis on 18 centralised nodes and 25 connected CDs. The trial started on 10 October on 11 CDs and on 24 October on 14 Cds respectively.

During 2022, an agreement was reached between Poste Italiane and the Trade Unions on the centralisation of in-house processing relating to the Post Communication and Logistics (PCL) division. The aim of the new agreement is to deliver greater service efficiency in postal communication, enhancing the central resources in Poste Italiane's growth strategy. In a context in which the postal services sector is also evolving, the agreement concerns the bringing of in-house processing activities within the organisational scope of sorting, the concentration of these activities at the nodes where the product will be processed and sorted, and the evolution of the figure of in-house processing employee into production employee. The signing of the agreement confirms the spirit of trust and fruitful cooperation between Poste Italiane and the Trade Unions.

The agreement between Poste Italiane and the Trade Unions

{301}------------------------------------------------

On 21 November 2022, completing the relational path outlined in the agreement of 2 August 2022, the Company and the Trade Unions signed the Agreement Report with which the specific regulations for the implementation of the reorganisation project of the Postal, Communication and Logistics (PCL) function were identified. The Parties defined the micro-organisation of the Logistics Centres, as well as the management levers for about 1,700 redundant resources that are to be relocated to the counter, i.e. to Digital, Technology & Operations through the Insourcing project. Incentivised voluntary redundancies were activated for those resources that met the requirements. The Parties also redefined the management system for unsuitable delivery personnel, in relation to both temporary and permanent unfitness, adapting it to the new organisation of the sorting process. Provision was also made for the possible activation of voluntary mobility on an exceptional basis at territorial level, with a commitment to evaluate it upon conclusion of the reorganisation project. The Industrial relations system accompanying the reorganisation, which is scheduled to end in 2024, provides for a mechanism of discussion between the Company and Trade Unions at both central and territorial levels.

On 11 July 2022, the Company and Trade Unions set 28 and 29 March 2023 as the dates for the general elections of the Unitary Trade Union Representatives (RSU) and of the Workers' Safety Representatives (RSL) of the Companies Poste Italiane SpA, Postel SpA, Poste Vita SpA, Poste Assicura SpA, PostePay SpA and Nexive Network Srl. On 21 December 2022, the Parties signed the Agreement Report amending the RSU protocol of 27 February 2023, in which they confirmed the dates of the elections on 28 and 29 March 2023 and updated the number of production units due to the new company structure, especially with reference to the Digital, Technology & Operations function. On 17 January 2023, the Parties, without prejudice to the provisions of Law 300/70 and the National Agreement of 21 March 2000 whereby the heads of the RSU elected in Production Units employing more than 200 employees - are entitled to paid leave equal to 96 hours per year, in order to allow each RSU to benefit from the above-mentioned pro-rata leave, limited to the year 2023 and for Production Units employing more than 200 employees, have provided that each RSU currently in office shall benefit, until the date on which the new representatives take office, from 1/3 (32 hours) of the 96 hours of leave available to him/her. Similarly, this provision will apply to Workers' Safety Representatives who, only for the year 2023 and until the date on which the new representatives take office, will be entitled to 1/3 (10 hours) of the 30 hours per year per capita of paid leave. Following the elections on 28 and 29 March 2023, the members of the RSU/RLS who are validly elected and appointed will be able to take the remaining 2/3 hours of RSU and RLS leave for the year 2023. With regard to RSU elected in production units employing up to 200 employees, it has been provided that the provisions of article 2 of the Agreement of 21 March 2000 will be applied, with the annual entitlement of leave hours being re-proportioned to the extent of 1/3 for incumbent RSU and 2/3 for RSU to be elected.

Lastly, in view of the persisting Covid-19 emergency, the Company and the Trade Unions continued their discussions within the OPN (Organismo Paritetico Nazionale per la Salute e la Sicurezza sul Lavoro - National Joint Committee for Occupational Health and Safety) Committee aimed at guaranteeing the safety of people and the containment of the virus by favouring the use of smart working and monitoring the preventive screening activities implemented by the Company. On 6 July 2022, the Company and the Trade Unions continued their discussions within OPN in order to give continuity, according to the new indications contained in the aforementioned Protocol of 30 June 2022, to the measures to contain the Covid-19 virus.

Also in the context of the work of the OPN Committee, the Parties, at the meetings of 30 November 2022, 1 February 2023 and 20 March 2023, defined the project structure and methodology that will be followed for the new detection of the risk of Work-Related Stress, initiating the same by proceeding in the meeting of 20 March to draw the name of workers who will be part of the Regional Assessment Teams that will have the task of compiling the INAIL check list. At the regional level, specific OPR sessions will be convened to illustrate the methodology that will be followed for the new survey, which is to be completed by the end of July, in order to start the subsequent activity of analysing the results and verifying them for the purpose of determining the risk level.

In the context of the OPN work of 20 March 2023, the Company, in view of the positive evolution of the Covid 19 pandemic crisis - which in fact has led to the re-establishment of the processes and procedures in place in the pre-pandemic period in practically all production and social sectors informed the OPN that - always in compliance with the principle of precaution and protection aimed at ensuring the appropriate levels and standards of safety in the workplace - a gradual process of reviewing the prevention measures adopted in the Company in the initial phase and during the evolution of the pandemic crisis to counter the spread of the virus will be initiated.

All of the Agreements and Understandings adopted have shown the substantial effectiveness of the provisions and regulations contained therein. Proof of this is the fact that no agreement between the Parties has recently been terminated and that the majority of Trade Union Agreements always find the consensus (signature) of all six signatories of the CCNL. From the Company's point of view, the various agreements signed have made an important contribution to the realisation of the plan's objectives. By way of example, the implementation of the new organisational model of delivery, the so-called Joint Delivery, was made possible through the signing of the Agreement of 8 February 2018 that redesigned the organisation of Poste Italiane SpA's mail delivery, as well as with the recent Agreements of 2/8/2022 and 21/11/2022 which allowed the process of streamlining and rationalising Internal Delivery Processing to begin.

# Participatory organisations with mixed composition (members from Poste Italiane and Labour Unions)

Together with the labour unions, Poste Italiane has set up joint bilateral bodies at national level regarding issues that are also relevant in terms of sustainability, including:

- z *Comitato per l'Attuazione dei Principi di Parità di Trattamento e Uguaglianza di Opportunità* (The Committee for Implementation of the Principles of Equal Treatment and Equal Opportunities), with the objective of "implementing and strengthening a culture that pays attention to diversity, including gender diversity, through positive actions aimed at creating examples of good practice within the Group and removing obstacles that actually prevent achievement of equal opportunities". In this context, the Committee addresses issues relating to the integration and inclusion of disabled people, as well as those regarding other factors of discrimination.
- z *Ente Bilaterale per la Formazione e Riqualificazione Professionale* (The Bilateral Agency for Personnel Training and Retraining), through which the Parties joint-

# Occupational health and safety

The Poste Italiane Group considers the protection of health and safety at work a fundamental value, which all people must be inspired by in carrying out their daily activities. The Company, in addition to having identified organisational responsibilities and having specific policies, in line with legislation, collective bargaining and national and international reference standards (e.g. ILO) to ensure adequate supervision of all aspects of occupational health and safety it is constantly committed to taking all necessary measures to reduce accidents, injuries and occupational diseases. These policies are implemented with reference to all Group operations, including activities related to partners and suppliers, and are addressed to each individual working for or under the supervision of Poste Italiane. Moreover, through prevention policies and programmes and information and awareness campaigns, it promotes people's psychophysical well-being. The Group's Chief Executive Officer, as Employer, is the highest figure responsible and in charge of overseeing health and safety issues in the Company. The Board of Directors approves the Policy and, through its Endoconsiliary Committees, supervises the appropriate management of the risks involved and the respect of the relevant principles.

At the end of 2018, the Osservatorio Paritetico sulla Sanità Integrativa (Joint Observatory on Supplementary Healthcare) was set up, with the role of proposing and monitoring the services offered by the Supplementary Healthcare Fund.
#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

The integrated policy and the Group health and safety policy define the key elements of the occupational health and safety management systems adopted, including:

- z continuous assessment of risks and definition/update of related rules and procedures;
- z ensuring that innovations and changes in work processes are always accompanied by occupational health and safety objectives;
- z timely adaptation to all regulatory changes and updates;
- z identification of roles and responsibilities within the organisation and allocation of the necessary resources for planning and implementing the programmes aimed at achieving the objectives;
- z effective and transparent communication that ensures dissemination of any information that might be useful for prevention purposes, including cooperation and coordination measures with contractors;
- z periodic review of the management system by top management to assess its correctness and effectiveness with a view to achieving constant improvement;
- z the prioritisation of the actions to be implemented in order to manage the risks related to health and safety at work, identified during the assessment phase, and the consequent integration of the action plans with quantitative objectives to address the above risks.

{303}------------------------------------------------

Starting with the integrated policy and the Group policy, each employer has approved the policy for its production unit, making it available to all workers. For the purposes of the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS), the responsibility of each production unit of the Parent company and the main Group companies lies with its employer. Within the Parent Company, employers are assisted by the Corporate Affairs/ Corporate Protection function, which ensures, at Group level, policy, coordination and control activities relating to Health, Safety at Work and the Environment, taking care, in particular for the Parent Company, of the design, implementation and dissemination of Occupational Health and Safety and Environmental Protection Management systems, in line with the current regulatory framework.

Occupational health and safety issues are a priority for the Group. In this regard, Poste Italiane has defined quantifiable targets for Business Unit managers, which are evaluated on an accident reduction target. In fact, the CEO, the top management and all those responsible up to the fifth organisational level were assessed on an accident reduction target. The Company has also set up dedicated teams with the specific task of monitoring the data relevant to the defined quantitative targets on a daily basis.

Promoting and developing a shared safety culture at all organisational levels of Poste Italiane is an enabling factor to reduce accidents and encourage the constant improvement of the management systems adopted

Among the main objectives pursued by Poste Italiane, the continuous awareness and involvement on the subject of Health and Safety at Work of all those who work within the Group is fundamental and a priority. Of particular importance is the dissemination and enhancement of the safety culture within the territorial operational centres (distribution centres and Post Offices) and their coordination structures. In addition, the Company is committed to the continuous improvement of its Management Systems, through the planning and execution of initiatives aimed at implementing the principles set out in the Occupational Safety Policy, and in the periodic review for the definition of new challenging objectives.

For years, Poste Italiane has pursued the objective of reducing accidents, especially in the sectors most exposed to road traffic risk, such as logistics and delivery (postal mechanisation and distribution centres). The constant monitoring and control of said phenomenon contributed, also in 2022, to the implementation of various initiatives on prevention and on occupational health of workers and protection of the workplace. From this point of view, the Occupational Safety Management Systems, which have already been adopted for some time in accordance with the regulations in force, confirm the conviction that an effective management system makes it possible both to manage the safety of workers in an organic and systematic manner and to implement and develop the Company's safety policy by monitoring the risks of all operational processes. Poste Italiane, aware of the fact that the continuous improvement of OHS Management Systems is conditional on the contribution and participation of all workers, according to the roles and responsibilities assigned, is committed to disseminating and enhancing the culture of safety from a systemic and participatory perspective.

The activities carried out to achieve the objectives include continuous training, awareness and involvement of personnel on OHS issues, plant-structural site improvements, continuous improvement and maintenance of Management System certification, as well as constant risk assessment in relation to processes and workplaces, monitoring of the implementation of the Improvement Plans referred to in the risk assessment, and constant checks on compliance with the requirements of current legislation.

Poste Italiane Group allocates annual budgets dedicated to the implementation of improvement plans for occupational health and safety aspects. In particular, the Company invests heavily in the maintenance of its real estate and in the continuous improvement of its plant and structural aspects. Equally important are the resources deployed for the management and maintenance of the company fleet, for the implementation of training, information and education campaigns, as well as those for OHS audits/controls, health surveillance, and the development and maintenance of systems/applications supporting the management of the issue.

In the risk assessment process, the Group analyses all potentially hazardous situations related to work processes and workplaces and, after identifying their potential to cause harm, assesses the associated level of risk. The assessment takes into account the actual manner in which the work is carried out and the exposure of personnel, as well as any protective measures already in place in accordance with the criteria defined by current technical regulations, technical standards, good engineering practice and company guidelines. In particular, the Company considers all foreseeable and objectively present hazards related to work activities, those arising from the correct and normal use of equipment/machines/plants, those foreseeable due to exceptional conditions and those due to possible malfunctions or failures. Systematic control of all possible hazards applicable to and correlated with workplaces and processes is guaranteed by the preliminary compilation of a check list annexed to the company procedure "Risk Assessment Document Management". The Employer refers to the skills of the Prevention and Protection Service to supervise and carry out the risk assessment with the consequent drawing up of the Risk Assessment Document (DVR) as well as of all the relevant specialist technical reports.

In particular, with regard to occupational health and safety risk management, this is also achieved through dialogue and the continuous exchange of information between human resources, managers and the various Business Units. On a quarterly basis, the competent control function coordinates with the risk specialists and, through them, also with the risk owners, with regard to monitoring activities on the trend of risk indicators and treatment actions related to the Top Risks concerning health and safety at work. The result of the activities is represented in quarterly integrated risk monitoring reports and presented to senior management and the Control and Risk Committee (CCR). This is followed by an annual reporting 

{304}------------------------------------------------

phase of the activities through the consolidation of the contributions from the various control functions within the "Risk and Compliance Report". This is presented to the Corporate Bodies and Top Management and provides a concise and integrated view of the initiatives promoted and/or introduced during the year in the various aspects of corporate operations, under the coordination of the Joint General Manager, as well as the main activities and interventions carried out by the structures of the function to ensure the implementation of appropriate safeguards, tools and organisational structures for the continuous strengthening of the Internal Control and Risk Management System and for the management of relevant compliance and sustainability issues.

In addition to the compulsory training imparted to all Personnel, the Group transmits in controlled form the Safety Operating Instructions (IOS) that describe the dangers related to the work processes concerned, as well as the organisational, preventive and protective measures for reduction of the corresponding level of risk. Within them, the IOS include the obligation (deriving from Legislative Decree 81/08) for workers to report the presence of possible dangers or dangerous situations at work to the person in charge and/or the competent Workers' Safety Representative, as well as containing a detailed description of the roles and tasks of the main players in safety management. Similarly, the Compliance Officers and Managers are required to collect such reports and to act in accordance with the Company procedures identified for the management of critical issues, respecting the timescales and methods corresponding to the level of risk associated with them. Considering the relevance of this issue, Poste Italiane has adopted information, education and training mechanisms for all employees, in order to adequately manage, in accordance with both the protective measures set out in the Risk Assessment Document and the corporate reference, any work situations from which injuries or occupational diseases could result.

The Company, in line with specific processes codified within the adopted health and safety management systems, carries out near-miss and accident analysis at work. With a view to continuous improvement, each production unit of the parent company and the Group companies carry out constant monitoring of accidents, specifically related to incidents, in order to identify - or manage - the triggering factors.

By means of the three-year moving average, which considers accident data from 2017 until 2022, before and after Covid-19, it is possible to observe the development of the number of occupational accidents of the Parent company. This metric, in addition to mitigating the distorting effects caused by exceptional events (such as pandemics) in the calculation of the accident trend, makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of management actions aimed at containing the risk factors controllable by the Company (such as the progressive adoption of the Lean methodology in the sorting centres), with a medium to long term time horizon.

Health Surveillance is carried out in the Group by a pool of company doctors who, within specific territorial perimeters, carry out the provisions of article 41 of Legislative Decree 81/08 (visits, inspections, periodic meetings, spot consultations). The network is coordinated by a competent doctor who supports the Employers and the Prevention and Protection Service for the governance aspects of health surveillance. The Risk Assessment Document for tabulated risks, pursuant to Legislative Decree 81/2008, as amended, and the Group's five Health Protocols list the activities subject to health prevention measures:

- z specific risk of manual handling of loads;
- z specific risk from exposure to display screen equipment;
- z night work;
- z no addiction to narcotic and psychotropic substances, no alcohol dependence;
- z specific risk from site inspections.

With regard to workers engaged in tasks/activities involving exposure to a specific (tabulated or assessed) risk, a health surveillance programme is activated, which includes medical examinations, supplementary health checks and toxicological tests.

During 2022, Health Surveillance activities were carried out continuously, throughout the country, in compliance with health protocols and current regulations. In addition, until September 2022, exceptional Health Surveillance was ensured for personnel with a "Fragility" condition, as well as the management of the post-sickness return process from Covid-19 with the adoption of all the necessary precautionary solutions for the worker's health to cope with the risk from SARS-CoV-2.

The Workers' Safety Representatives (RLS), who are among the main players in the management of health and safety in the workplace, are chosen directly by the workers within the framework of the Company's trade union representatives, as provided for by Legislative Decree 81/08. The RLS are periodically consulted not only following the introduction of new risk assessment methodologies, but also on the occasion of organisational or process changes that may have an impact on occupational health and safety, as well as during the drafting of the Risk Assessment Document. Adequate, timely and preventive consultation with the RLS allows them to obtain useful advice for the timely fulfilment of legislative obligations and for the continuous improvement of workers' health and safety. The consultation may concern all the Workers' Safety Representatives of the national territory or only those of a specific territory.

Discussion between employers and workers, promoted by the Group, takes place through the National Joint Observatory (OPN) and the Regional Joint Bodies (OPR). Thanks to these committees, in which national and territorial, employer, trade union and RLS representatives participate, the Company involves all stakeholders in order to address specific health and safety issues arising also from workers' reports, share occupational health and safety initiatives and start the process of consulting RLS on risk assessment. Therefore, Joint Bodies meetings are convened whenever the need arises and not according to a pre-established schedule.

{305}------------------------------------------------

Over the years, Poste Italiane has defined a multi-year plan for the Company-wide adoption of health and safety certifications, which in 2021, led to the completion of the certification process for all of the Parent Company's production units. In 2022, Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems compliant with the UNI ISO 45001 standard were kept active, with related certifications, in all the production units of the Parent Company, according to the plans and strategic objectives set. Group companies also adopt OHS Management Systems certified by accredited certification bodies. As of 2022, the main Group companies certified according to the UNI ISO 45001 standard are: EGI SpA, PosteVita SpA, PosteAssicura SpA, SDA SpA, Postel SpA, Poste Air Cargo Srl, Bancoposta Fondi SpA, Postepay SpA Poste Italiane's goal is to maintain this certification in all of the production units of Poste Italiane SpA and of Group Companies.

Health and Safety at Work audits and controls are systematically carried out not only by each production unit within its own OHS Management Systems, but also by Corporate Protection, transversally, in each production unit of the Parent Company and in the Group Companies. Specifically, the activities carried out in 2022 by the latter consist of:

- z audits on Occupational Health and Safety/Environment Management Systems with the aim of verifying that the management systems adopted in the Company comply with the requirements of the reference standards and that they are correctly implemented and maintained;
- z technical audit, control activity aimed at analysing and evaluating the state of OHS compliance of sites, with particular reference to plant/structural aspects;
- z operational checks and raising awareness of the health and safety of personnel working at sites, in particular operational checks at Delivery Centres and Post Offices aimed at assessing the overall state of safety in terms of infrastructure, systems and working processes.

To monitor and control the effectiveness of the OHS policies adopted, Poste Italiane uses several tools, including:

- z GISLA (Computer, Occupational Safety and Environment Management);
- z Platforms for training management;
- z GIW (Digital Accident Management);
- z SSA (Safety Self Assessment);
- z Real Gimm (share for the management of maintenance impacting OHS);
- z File Maker (share for the management of real estate works impacting OHS);
- z EDVR (Electronic management of Risk Assessment Documents);
- z EPI (Emergency Management Poste Italiane);
- z Green Pass (GP Control System).

{306}------------------------------------------------

The performance and targets set are constantly monitored and reviewed at the planned review of adopted OHS Management Systems.

Finally, it should be noted that with the end of the state of health emergency on 31 March 2022 and the improvement in the epidemiological development, mainly linked to the considerable reduction in the expected damage in the event of contagion, a reshaping of the anti-contagion measures was implemented during 2022. Specifically, the protective measures adopted according to the actual level of risk, the regulatory framework in force from time to time and the indications of the Health Authority, were as follows:

- z information to external personnel (maintenance staff, consultants, customers, etc.) and employees about the risk containment measures adopted by the Company and the relevant rules of conduct;
- z distribution, at such intervals as to ensure their availability at all times, of respiratory protective masks for all workers;
- z publication of safety procedures and operating instructions for the management of symptomatic cases and Covid-19 cases in the Company;
- z communication campaigns aimed at continuously raising staff awareness on the adoption of correct behaviour aimed at preventing the risk of infection.

In any case, the Committee for monitoring the implementation of the described protection measures, established by specific agreement within the National Joint Observatory, remains active.

With specific reference to the logistics and delivery sector, which is the sector most exposed to road traffic risks, Poste Italiane implemented several initiatives, including the constant risk assessment and updating of risk assessment documents (DVR) following the reorganisations in the delivery sector and the measures taken to combat Covid-19.

It is planned to record any type of event (from unsafe condition to unsafe action, medication and near miss) in a new computer application, S-EWO, with an in-depth analysis of the dynamics of accidents, as well as to increase the use of the sanctioning lever in cases of non-compliance with existing procedures/instructions.

In order to share information on the accident phenomenon with the territory, daily, weekly and monthly reports were produced centrally. Furthermore, in order to adequately analyse the phenomenon and share best practices, it is emphasised that there is a monthly Security Committee with all Macro Logistics Areas (MAL) coordinated by the central Security and Infrastructure structure.

With regard to the reduction of accident events, the Group has replaced all equipment that is a source of potential accidents with new equipment, such as Automated guided vehicles instead of man-mounted trucks and/or pallet trucks.

Lastly, thanks to constant innovation, Poste Italiane uses modern types of sorting equipment (TOP2K, XMS, Solysort, Easy Sorter) and has introduced the "App Safety" function for the post officer's PDA that allows:

- z self-certification by workers of the PPE worn prior to the start of outdoor work;
- z increasing the risk awareness of post officers by involving them in the detection of unsafe conditions, near misses and accidents;
- z promptly informing post officers of imminently dangerous conditions;

# Protection of human rights

Poste Italiane is aware of the key role it can play in promoting the principles of sustainable development, given its great importance as a Company within the Italian economic and social context. Therefore, the Group has adopted a Code of Ethics, supported by several corporate policies and guidelines to protect and safeguard Human Rights. These include the Corporate Policy on the Protection and Safeguarding of Human Rights, the Policy on the Diversity of Management and Control Bodies, the Diversity & Inclusion Policy and the more recent Active Parenting Support Policy. Moreover, in compliance with the international principles concerning the protection and safeguard of Human Rights, in addition to following the above-mentioned corporate policies and guidelines, Poste Italiane is committed to ensuring the well-being of all the people working in the Company or collaborating with it, and to improving the conditions of the community in which it operates, by playing an active role in the dissemination of the principles laid down in the regulations and international standards.

Poste Italiane is committed to assuming increasing responsibility for the protection of Human Rights, both in the interest of the people who work with the Company and those in the community in which it operates

The Group's Corporate Policy concerning the safeguard and protection of Human Rights reiterates the rules of conduct to be observed in relations with all stakeholders with whom the Company interacts, as already set out in the Code of Ethics. Poste Italiane pays particular attention to the protection of the rights of all those who are included in the Group's value chain, and who belong to specific categories such as: own workers, women, children, indigenous people, migrants, external workers, local communities, suppliers and partners, customers, people with disabilities, and people who are victims of any form of discrimination and violence. The Policy sets out the Company's commitment to align company processes with the main international standards and best practices, and to promote these principles and periodically report on the performance achieved, in terms of management and monitoring methods, identified risks and management and mitigation actions. The Policy also regulates various aspects concerning the prevention and condemnation of all forms of discrimination or violence, including forced or child labour and human trafficking, and promotes freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and fair remuneration, with the aim of supporting personal well-being.

Poste Italiane considers it essential to encourage and develop a business culture based on respect for and appreciation of diversity in all its forms and manifestations, at all levels of the organisation. Managing diversity in an inclusive manner not only creates shared social values, but also provides a competitive advantage for the entire Group and intensifies people's engagement and commitment to the Company's goals.

#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

The projects and initiatives promoted by Poste Italiane in order to ensure social inclusion and enhance diversity are part of a broader strategic framework, which is aimed at developing balanced organisational models that favour communication and the emergence of personal characteristics, while protecting individual vulnerability. The path taken by the Group is geared towards evolving from an approach focused only on the protection and integration of diversity, towards a more proactive strategy aimed at overcoming barriers and solving the factors that hinder the employment inclusion of individuals. In fact, the Company's mission and strategy on diversity and inclusion are defined with the aim of creating a collaborative, supportive and open working environment that allows the Group to maximise the resulting opportunities, both for the well-being of the Company and for competitive advantage in the business.

The Group has enshrined its guiding principles and values through the elaboration and formalisation by the Board of Directors of a Diversity & Inclusion Policy, through which the governing body defines measurable, multi-year objectives. In particular, the Diversity & Inclusion Policy is based on four pillars: Gender, Generations, Disability/Vulnerability and Interculturality/Inclusive Culture, and was developed through a bottom-up process involving listening to the ideas and the needs of the corporate population. Thanks to this process, numerous projects were proposed on topics such as development and opportunity, open communication, inclusion and care, participation and dialogue, culture and awareness. The Policy is available online on the company website, and is communicated to all employees through specific training sessions, based on roles and responsibilities. With reference to updating, the Policy is evaluated at least once a year, based on the evidence emerging from the assessments and from the monitoring of national and international trends.

# Gender

The Group has embarked on a path with more than 10 projects to support gender equality and remove obstacles to women's professional development. In particular, the Group contemplates the strengthening of governance systems for career progression, the design of composite focus groups aimed at assessing the main conscious or unconscious biases that influence inclusive leadership, improving work life adjustment mechanisms in terms of reconciling and sharing family responsibilities, and adhering to the path for the prestigious international Equal Salary certification, achieved in November 2022, as per the ESG plan, further sanctioning and confirming the Group's commitment to pay equity between women and men within the organisation.

The Group broadened its focus on issues concerning sexual orientation and the prevention of gender harassment in the workplace by extending an information programme to raise awareness among all employees. The aim is to provide an overview of gender harassment and its impacts on individuals and organisations, to promote a culture of respect in the workplace.

### Generations

Poste Italiane promotes integrated strategies to foster dialogue and exchange between the different generations within the Company, taking into account demographic perspectives and their effects on turnover. The Group promotes the contamination of different social, cultural and professional experiences, as well as the different skills, knowledge and competences typical of each generation. This openness to complementarity and diversity encourages the interchange of experiences to support inclusion and employment opportunities.

# Disability/Vulnerability

The Company has undertaken awareness-raising initiatives at a collective level to preventively recognise situations of vulnerability and facilitate job placement and quality of work for people with sensory, motor or cognitive disabilities.

In this context, Poste Italiane is committed to developing intervention policies aimed at spreading an inclusive business culture and introducing a distinctive identity that takes into account situations of fragility.

# Interculturality/Inclusive culture

Poste Italiane has designed multi-year initiatives aimed at promoting interaction between different cultures and experiences through envisioning programmes and the dissemination of knowledge in organisational and managerial environments, with the objective of promoting a cross-cultural vision open to multi-level confrontation and geared to organisational and social cooperation.

The Diversity & Inclusion programmes, in line with the provisions of the Company Policy, are monitored using indicators developed annually in collaboration with the Group's Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function in the Corporate Affairs area, in line with the evolutionary guidelines of the corporate sustainability plan.

Poste Italiane maintains, in continuity with the previous year, its Diversity & Inclusion Plan, drawn up following an active participation process which envisaged the establishment of cross-functional working groups made up of professionals and middle-managers who operated according to a bottom-up logic, elaborating project proposals that have been evaluated on the basis of two variables, the qualitative-quantitative impact on the company population and the speed of implementation. The Plan is aimed at generating significant change processes that bring added value to people, organisational behaviour, leadership styles and relationships within the Group. Through the implementation of targeted projects and initiatives, as well as communication and awareness-raising campaigns, the Group promotes engagement, listening and trust, the creation of inclusive working environments, and in general, the improvement of the corporate organisation through the enhancement of differences.

Moreover, to further spread knowledge and understanding of the importance of each individual within the Company and of the initiatives supporting diversity, and to promote the contamination of different cultures and experiences in order to trigger participatory processes characterised by the co-presence of a set of different cultures among people, a special "Diversity & Inclusion" section is available on the NoidiPoste corporate intranet, containing news, documents and multimedia material. Finally, a series of podcasts entitled "In Other Words" was launched, which aims to focus on listening in the telling of stories of diversity and inclusion.

The Company's commitment to promoting an inclusive culture is a cultural journey that can enrich the experience of staff throughout their working careers, with both individual and collective benefits. To this end, the Company works constantly and systematically, implementing synergistic actions to develop analysis models and indicators consistent with people management processes. This system allows management to evaluate scenarios, objectives and metrics in a transparent and visible manner both within the organisation and for external stakeholders.

#### Smart Café

#### Thematic paths on interculturality

To underline the Group's commitment to promoting initiatives for development and integration of the management community, Poste Italiane is carrying out the "Smart Café" project, which consists of conversations dedicated to managers with the aim of fostering dialogue with a high level of interculturality at work and beyond.

These conversations focus on thematic paths that make different cultures and knowledge visible, also considering generational differences. Using an innovative mode of communication and relationship, the project aims to create an intercultural space for the exchange of contributions, points of view and social, cultural and work experiences.

In particular, with the special edition of "Smart Café" dedicated to generational confrontation, the contamination of different social, cultural and work experiences is promoted to strengthen the alliance at work between the different generations.

Poste Italiane obtains the

Diversity and Inclusion

Acknowledgement

In 2022, the Company was certified according to the standard ISO 30415:2021 Human resource management - Diversity and Inclusion for its ability to integrate the principles of diversity and inclusion in all processes of design, direction, control, coordination and delivery of postal, financial, insurance and digital services. The Group is the first large company in the FTSE MIB certified according to the Uni ISO 30415:2021 standard, an acknowledgement that once again confirms the central role that Poste Italiane assigns to the principles of sustainable development.

The conscious management of diversity in an inclusive key, in addition to creating shared social value, determines a competitive advantage for the entire Group and is functional to promoting people's engagement with respect to corporate objectives. In fact, obtaining the ISO 30415 certification represents a further merit of the Company, which is added to other important recognitions obtained by Poste Italiane.

During 2022, the first 8 innovation workshops were also conducted for territorial operational heads, who, with the methodology of polarity thinking, concretely tackled the issues related to one of the four aspects that make up the Diversity & Inclusion Policy, putting themselves into play concretely and drawing up their own personal action plan.

During the year, all Diversity & Inclusion activities were carefully monitored and evaluated through a feedback system to ensure continuous improvement and to enable participants to co-design subsequent initiatives. The Company recognised the importance of increasingly integrating the social, relational and process dimensions of Diversity & Inclusion into its strategic vision. To this end, a survey was launched in November on the entire company population through the survey "Poste IN Diversity & Inclusion according to you", which aims to gather information on individual and collective knowledge and perception of Diversity & Inclusion issues, as well as the Company's commitment in this area. Specifically, employees' perceptions on the following different areas were requested:

- z Diversity & Inclusion knowledge of respondents;
- z Knowledge of the four areas of D&I;
- z D&I attitudes;
- z Ratings and opinions on D&I in the Company;
- z Knowledge and opinions of D&I projects and policies in Poste Italiane.

The survey was carried out in cooperation with "Work Wide Women", and was disseminated online via the company intranet, official news, TG Poste and the newsletter.

In order to prevent any possible negative impact on the corporate population to whom the initiatives are addressed, all events are publicised, enhanced and communicated on the internal website, so that the corporate action in this area can be made known and the population can participate. In addition, feedback is systematically provided to employee comments and reports on the company intranet community in order to ensure timely clarity of information and offer contextualisation elements useful for participation and contribution to the collection of any aspects of process improvement.

The main actions aimed at promoting Diversity & Inclusion are overseen in the Human Resources and Industrial Relations area through the People Care and Diversity Management function, set up in 2019, within which a contact person operates with the role of promoting the implementation of the project initiatives envisaged in the Diversity & Inclusion Plan, also taking care of programme management activities for cross-functional projects. To support these initiatives, a budget defined on the basis of annual planning is allocated. Generally speaking, Diversity & Inclusion projects and initiatives are managed by internal databases through dedicated company systems for mapping participants, reporting and monitoring, as well as through the company intranet.

In order to ensure alignment with market trends and best practices, the HR Research Centre continued its activities in 2022, participating in inter-company round tables, also exchanging views with associations and institutions to generate new opportunities, visions and enabling orientations with respect to corporate objectives. The Centre also provides selected content, organised in thematic areas presented in an innovative editorial manner, using the dedicated online site, available to all employees in Human Resources and Organisation. The user-friendly platform encourages the exchange of information, the socialisation of experiences and the broad sharing of content and approaches in support of inclusive culture and people's well-being in general.

In order to act on the cultural awareness of the context in which Poste Italiane carries out its activities, professional figures called "Diversity and Inclusion Supporters" have also been identified, who operate in the Human Resources area throughout the country, with the aim of supporting and disseminating corporate initiatives and gathering suggestions and ideas from staff in the relevant areas, always in a bottom-up logic of collaboration and expression of needs, involving all corporate entities. The supporters were also included in a training course with the Palo Alto School to acquire the techniques of animation and management of corporate communities.

A wide range of initiatives promoted by the Company translate the principles of inclusion and equal opportunities into action. Fundamental to this was the drafting of the "Framework agreement on harassment and violence in the workplace", with which the Group aims to maintain a working environment in which respect and dignity are guaranteed for each person. Poste Italiane also cooperates with the two main advocacy organisations operating at national level, the Anti-Violence Network "D.i.Re" (Donne in Rete) and the voluntary association "Telefono Rosa", and finances a fund for the economic and working autonomy of women victims of violence, providing many of them with training opportunities, job placement 

{313}------------------------------------------------

and in some cases accommodation. The principle of equal career development opportunities is applied by ensuring that personnel selection is carried out on the basis of professionalism and skills in accordance with the Company's needs, regardless of personal characteristics such as age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, nationality, political opinions and religious beliefs.

lodgings were made available for 40 women victims of violence throughout the country

There are also many good Company practices supporting maternity and paternity. In cooperation with "Valore D", an association of companies promoting diversity, talent and female leadership, Poste Italiane has committed to managerial training to promote the professional growth of its female employees. Poste Italiane promotes activities to raise awareness of gender-based violence through awareness-raising initiatives and constantly monitors the impact of such activities on the territory, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding entered into with the Ministry of Equal Opportunities, To this end, institutional messages of awareness-raising on these issues are visible on the screens of Postamat ATMs. In addition, the counter monitors also provide useful information such as the freephone number 1522 and the app for preventing and combating violence, including stalking and mistreatment.

Poste Italiane pays particular attention to every aspect that can increasingly reconcile work and family life, as well as to instances of violence against women. Faced with the emergency and the difficult consequences of the pandemic on the condition of women victims of violence, and given the availability of its own residential accommodation, the Group promoted the project "Housing autonomy for women victims of violence". The project, introduced in 2021, is in continuity with the project aimed at the labour inclusion of women victims of violence and their job placement launched in 2019. Poste Italiane has confirmed its commitment to these issues by fully funding the initiative for the second year running, demonstrating its leadership among companies on the Italian social sustainability scene. An important phase of the project was completed in March 2022, with the identification of 10 housing units belonging to the Company's real estate throughout the country to be reserved for the independent living of women and their daughters and minor children who find themselves in a particularly difficult economic situation, for a maximum of about 40 women per year, and for a total of 200 pathways to be followed over the entire duration of the project. Nine regions were involved, namely the provinces of Vercelli, Brescia, Padua, Bologna, Macerata, Rome, Bari, Naples, Salerno and Messina. The five-year project is coordinated by the Corporate Social Responsibility function in collaboration with the Real Estate function, and is enriched by the consolidation of the partnership with the associations D.i.Re (Donne in Rete) and Differenza Donna, Third Sector organisations working to combat gender-based violence, widely present throughout the country, with the task of selecting women and following them along the entire path of housing autonomy.

Moreover, through the "Mortgage loan instalment suspension", Poste Italiane's commitment to the inclusion of women victims of violence through the implementation of the memorandum of understanding between ABI and the Trade Unions, to facilitate the repayment of loans by women victims of gender-based violence, was confirmed for 2022 as well. In addition, the Company signed the three-year Protocol on the implementation of policies on gender equality, equal opportunities and combating gender-based violence with the Ministry for Equal Opportunities and the Family on 13 April 2022, confirming its commitment within a broader institutional framework. The agreement signed on 25 November 2019 between ABI and the Trade Unions, which provides for suspending, where required, the payment of the capital portion of the instalments of mortgages taken out by women victims of gender-based violence who are on certified protection pathways and are in economic difficulty, was recently extended until 25 November 2023. Therefore, Poste Italiane, in continuity with the actions already undertaken, in agreement with the lending banks Deutsche Bank SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, has implemented the agreement with ABI and offers women the possibility of requesting the suspension of the payment of the principal amount of mortgage loans, with the corresponding extension of the amortisation plan, for a period not exceeding 18 months and in any case not exceeding the duration of the "protection path".

In relation to the Company's commitment to combating gender-based violence and the Housing Autonomy project, Poste Italiane held a webinar dedicated to project contact persons and Human Resources Managers. The aim of the initiative was to raise awareness on the topic of gender-based harassment and violence and the main tools to recognise the phenomenon and prevent it, while offering an overview of programmes for the employment and housing inclusion of women victims of violence.

Furthermore, during 2022, in order to strengthen the Group's commitment to its diversity and inclusion policies, an intervention plan has been identified in the area of affective orientation and gender identity, divided into the following areas, for which four working tables have been set up:

- z Active parenthood: concerns the regulation of the employment relationship and in particular the institutes pertaining to parenthood and their application to homogeneous families. This is an area characterised by an important legislative intervention such as the Cirinnà Law no. 76 of 2016, which introduced same-sex civil unions into the Italian legal system;
- z Change of corporate culture: focused on training and informing staff at all levels of the organisation to raise the level of awareness of each employee and overcome prejudices that often condition people's behaviour;
- z Gender transition: the topic has important impacts in the corporate area in various aspects, from the initial phase of finding employment to dress codes, from management support for bosses and employees to identification docu-

{314}------------------------------------------------

ments during the transition process, to the rules of use of company premises (e.g. changing rooms and toilets). A further area for exploration is the possible support interventions that the Supplementary Health Fund can provide to accompany the transition process;

- z LGBTQI+ Policy: drafting of a company policy that integrates the principles, values and rules that the Company intends to adopt with regard to standards of behaviour and internal organisational processes, also making a structured synthesis of the results emerging from the other working tables.
Poste Italiane considers to be of primary importance, and which it promotes and pursues also within its governing bodies. For this reason, the Group has adopted a "Diversity Policy for Management and Supervisory Bodies", which is the document with which the Company declares its responsibility to adopt a perspective of this value

The Policy establishes the criteria for a qualitative and quantitative composition of the Board of Directors functional to the effective performance of the tasks and responsibilities entrusted to it, through the presence of individuals who ensure a sufficient degree of diversity of perspectives and skills, which are crucial for a good understanding of current affairs and the risks and opportunities associated with running the Company's business over the long term.

The Policy defines the criteria for selecting the members of the Board of Directors according to their responsibilities and tasks, as well as ensuring the presence of people with differ44.4% of the BoD of the Parent Company is made up of women

ent perspectives and competences, who are able to manage the risks and opportunities related to the Company's business in the long term. Through the Policy, the Group is able to ensure a qualitative composition of the Board of Directors that is optimal for the effective performance of its functions. In defining said criteria, the Board of Directors considered various factors, such as the nature and complexity of the Company's business, the social and environmental context in which the Company operates, the experience gained by the Board itself with regard to the activities and functioning methods of the Board and of the internal Board Committees, as well as the results of the self-assessment processes carried out in recent years.

Finally, while respecting the requirements of professionalism, honour and independence, as well as situations of incompatibility and/or disqualification provided for by law, regulations and the By-laws, the Policy also takes into account age and seniority in office, gender, geographical origin and international experience. In addition, the Policy recommends specific professional expertise in the areas of finance or contribution policy, accounting and risk management, as well as adequate knowledge of the sector in which the Company operates in order to assess the associated risks.

The Company has started a partnership with "Parks - Free and Equal", a non-profit association whose members are exclusively employers, whose aim is to help member companies, organisations and institutions understand the business potential of developing diversity-friendly strategies and best practices, in order to create inclusive and respectful workplaces for all employees, and in particular those belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community.

Poste Italiane promotes policies of inclusion to protect diversity, and the collaboration with Parks allows this path to be further strengthened. Awareness-raising initiatives were implemented to value the richness of plurality, accompaniment in cases of gender transition, counselling in the definition of training and communication programmes, and evolutionary integration in work processes and relations.

The collaboration thus aims to strengthen the cultural positioning of the Company in its diversity management path.

In this context, Poste Italiane has undertaken a series of initiatives to promote an inclusive working environment that is attentive to the needs of people according to their different identities. These initiatives include the production of an episode of the company podcast "In other words", available on the company intranet and the NoidiPoste app, in which the Company emphasises the importance of creating an inclusive working environment that takes into account the different identities of people and their needs. Feeling welcome and included has a significant impact on the ability to relate and work effectively, crucial factors for an organisation that cares about the well-being of people both as individuals and as a community.

The Board of Directors, thanks to the assistance of an external company specialised in the sector, annually carries out the Board Review, a self-assessment in line with a procedure that involves conducting interviews, also making use of specific questionnaires, with each director, statutory auditor and with the Secretary of the Board of Directors.

The final report prepared by the commissioned company is reviewed and shared with the Board of Directors in its collegiality. The Board Review carried out in 2022 showed that the quality profile of the administrative body in terms of skills, professionalism, experience and diversity, in its various meanings, is appropriate.

#### Poste Italiane's D&I strategy "The Hidden Potential of Inclusion"

Poste Italiane was cited as one of the "inspirational cases" within the research report entitled 'The Hidden Potential of Inclusion', conducted by Lunquist.

The research was promoted with the aim of creating a space for dialogue and pragmatic comparison in order to build paths of transformation in the area of Diversity and inclusion. Therefore, the Poste Italiane Group was taken as a positive example for having adopted a strategy based on objectives and measurability of the same, with the following reason: "Poste Italiane, through 21 targets set in 2021 and scheduled to be reached in 2024, shows what it wants to achieve and when. A well-set goal is halfway achieved."

# Equal career development opportunities

Human Resources management is a priority for the Company, which is committed to ensuring respect for equal opportunities by recognising the value of each individual, and to reducing situations of individual fragility. In fact, as regulated in the Code of Ethics, the Group promotes the management and fair growth of intellectual potential, in line with the criteria of merit and the results achieved, guaranteeing equal treatment and condemning any form of discrimination. In accordance with this principle, the selection of the corporate population is based on individual skills and professionalism, in line with the Group's needs. The selection process is carried out irrespective of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, nationality, political opinions and religious beliefs, which are not evaluation criteria, in accordance with the principle of impartiality expressed by the Group.

The development and enhancement of people's distinctive skills, in all their forms and manifestations, at all levels of the organisation, are key factors in supporting the growth of the Group's business. Poste Italiane adopts an approach aimed at the widest involvement of employees, enhancing their skills throughout the value chain, in order to gain a competitive advantage in the market and to generate shared social value.

NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

By maintaining constant dialogue with its employees and containing all forms of discrimination, Poste Italiane is able to promote the well-being of each individual in the Company

In line with previous years, Poste Italiane supports the "Charter for Equal Opportunities and Equality at Work", a declaration of intent voluntarily signed by companies of various sizes with the aim of promoting a corporate culture and human resources policies that are inclusive and free of discrimination and prejudice. By supporting this statement, the Group reinforces its commitment to valuing the individuality and diversity of the people in the Company. In fact, the Charter promotes principles aimed at fostering the creation of a working environment that reflects the values of inclusion and pluralism, offering equal opportunities to all people and valuing individual skills. Encouraging and developing a corporate culture based on respect for and appreciation of diversity is also a prerequisite to develop remuneration systems functional to enhancing the skills of each individual, which can guarantee optimal work performance and thus contribute to the creation of lasting shared value.

Poste Italiane continues to implement what has been set out in the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Equal Opportunities, in line with its commitment to enhance 

{316}------------------------------------------------

diversity and to create a joint and effective action in communicating, raising awareness and disseminating the following issues:

- z promote initiatives aimed at the protection and full affirmation of human rights, as well as preventing and combating all forms of exploitation of human beings and people trafficking;
- z promote full implementation of policies regarding equal

# Supporting maternity and paternity

In line with previous years, the Lifeed initiative, launched in 2015 under the name "MAAM", "Maternity As A Master", which supports family reconciliation, with a special focus on women's participation in the world of work, continued in 2022. The programme, which can be used digitally, is aimed at enhancing parenting skills, which are also particularly useful when returning to work, in order to become more aware of the changes and skills acquired through the experience of caring for a child.

Registration is open to both women on maternity leave and new parents of children from 0 to 3 years of age, as well as managers involved with their employees, and from this year also parents of children up to the age of 18. During 2022, the programme involved the participation of about 900 users, who had the opportunity to enhance the skills acquired during their parenting experience.

The initiative is also supported by an online community that allows mothers and fathers to discuss parenting and the path they have taken, integrating their different experiences within a network of participants from various companies, sharing their learning, training and skills development process in a protected and stimulating environment.

In addition, a pilot edition of the MultiMe®Finder programme, a new tool offered by Lifeed in cooperation with the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Chicago, will be launched in 2022. This programme allows to explore and discover own skills and roles in different life experiences, both personal and professional. The initiative involved over 350 employees and extended not only to parents, but also to all people interested in improving their awareness and developing their skills for personal and professional growth. In fact, the programme aims to increase awareness of the roles played in different life experiences, enhancing the skills acquired as opportunities for personal growth, also in the work context.

The Group recognises the importance of parenting for men as well, being aware that it represents a significant opportunity to improve skills such as empathy, listening, understanding of others, patience and communication, and offers free and systematic parenting support seminars for all staff on paediatric prevention and parental support in the developmental and relational journey with children.

- z prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination directly or indirectly based on ethnic origin, religion, personal beliefs, age, sexual orientation or gender identity.

In addition, an Active Parenting Support Policy was approved in 2022, with the aim of creating a customised support programme based on the professional profile and personal needs of employees, as well as encapsulating the Company's programmes and regulations to support staff with children.

Through the Active Parenthood Support Policy, in line with ESG objectives, Poste Italiane strengthens its commitment to enhancing gender balance and overcoming stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice in the workplace, in order to promote conditions, measures and paths aimed at the individual and organisational well-being of people, focusing on paths to support the role of parents and actions to support the condition of women.

This programme consists of pre- and post-work development paths, the use of platforms to improve the soft skills acquired through parenthood, and the possibility of participating in refresher and coaching programmes to facilitate, if necessary, a return to work. In this way, the Group has introduced management and care processes that offer a concrete response to employees, enhancing inclusive policies and representing an investment in the future of the Company and families. Attention is also paid to the role of fathers and the sharing of care burdens in order to strengthen work-life balance mechanisms and measures to promote culturally ready contexts to accommodate these needs.

These initiatives are driven by increasingly innovative ways and perspectives, which aim to improve the quality of life of employees and promote a sustainable and fair working environment.

Within the actions envisaged by the Active Parenting Support Policy is also the launch of the "Mums At Work" project, which aims to offer company coaching programmes to support women returning from maternity leave, in order to facilitate the achievement of a work-life balance. In particular, new mothers are supported for about four months by in-house coaches who help employees refocus their goals and reconcile their new family needs with their return to their jobs at the Company.

dice to their duties. In addition, with regard to tasks that can be remote, from 2022, the possibility of increasing the number of days on which work can be performed in smart working has been introduced for parents of children under three years of age.

# Developing women's leadership

Poste Italiane's corporate identity has always been characterised by a strong female presence and a working environment free from all forms of discrimination and prejudice so that everyone can express themselves to the full, in accordance with the objectives shared in the Diversity and Inclusion Policy.

In the area of support for gender equality, numerous initiatives were promoted, starting with the partnership with "Valore D", and ending with the Equal Salary certification and the valorisation of STEM skills through the inclusion of young women with this course of study. These initiatives represent an important chapter of the Diversity & Inclusion Plan, which also includes strengthening management systems for career progression in middle management positions, enhancing work life adjustment mechanisms in terms of sharing family responsibilities, and removing potential obstacles to gender equality, including those related to sexual orientation and gender-based violence. Adhering to the Equal Salary certification pathway has enabled the Company to verify pay equity between women and men within its organisation,

# Alliance between the generations

The Company supports school and career guidance projects, recognising the responsibility of socially responsible companies to promote the growth of the younger generation and to collaborate with the school system and families. For this reason, Poste Italiane collaborated with Consel-Consorzio Elis to participate in the two-year "School4Life 2.0" project, aimed at fostering a structured connection between schools and businesses and preventing school drop-outs.

Poste Italiane has also implemented programmes to strengthen the alliance between the corporate world and the world of education, with initiatives for orientation and dialogue between generations. These programmes provided opportunities for collaboration between seniors and students to overcome vertical barriers and foster the exchange of experiences to support inclusion and employability.

enriching innovation processes, improving the Company's reputation and image, and offering maximum transparency with respect to Poste Italiane's ongoing commitment to gender equality issues.

The conscious management of diversity in an inclusive key, in addition to creating shared social value, determines a competitive advantage for the entire Poste Italiane Group and is functional to promoting people's engagement with respect to corporate goals. This is confirmed by the numerous awards obtained by Poste Italiane, including global leadership in gender equality according to Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index and entry into the Top 100 global rankings on gender equality compiled by Equileap.

The recognitions obtained by Poste Italiane for its policies of attention to gender diversity demonstrate the rooting of these values in the corporate culture and the sharing of the path at every level of responsibility, further enhancing the Group's reputation in the markets and among the financial community.

Role models, mentors and in the future also trade masters are the roles that the company experts identified play to inspire young people and guide them in their study and work choices, encourage the expression of their critical thinking, transfer trade-related skills and bring them closer to the complex and ever-changing world of work. In fact, Poste Italiane continued its collaboration with "Valore D" for the realisation of orientation programmes aimed at encouraging girls and boys of school age to follow their aspirations, free from gender conditioning, through dialogue with internal role models, in order to actively affect common stereotypes that accompany the younger generations.

{318}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane, as part of its actions in support of intergenerational exchange within the organisation, has promoted the "Generazioni Connesse" (Connected Generations) survey, an initiative in continuity with the "FishBowl generation" project, which aims to focus on the languages, working styles and needs of the main generations present in the Company in order to identify and enhance shared actions capable of stimulating generational alliance.

The survey analysed, among other aspects, the frequency and quality of relations between employees of different generations and gathered feedback and suggestions for improving collaboration between them. Numerous employees with a wide range of skills, including tellers, delivery personnel and staff members, participated in the survey. The results showed that most of the participants regularly have the opportunity to work with people from different generations and believe that generational differences represent an added value.

The research also provided relevant insights to develop further initiatives to foster dialogue and exchange between generations in labour relations, such as the experimental project "The value of experience", job training between pairs of employees of different generations to compare techniques, approaches and skills acted upon.

# Enhancement of disabled personnel

Consistent with the objective of enhancing diversity and social inclusion, the LIS Project continues at Poste Italiane in a number of Post Offices nationwide. This project aims to set up a desk offering services in sign language to customers with hearing disabilities. The customer is assisted by staff able to express themselves in Italian sign language for normal counter activities, such as paying bills and sending mail and parcels. Currently, the initiative involves 10 Post Offices with a total of 11 resources in the six Macro Territorial Areas. In September 2022, on the occasion of the International Day of Sign Language, Poste Italiane broadcast the webinar "Digital

# Supporting vulnerability

In 2022, Poste Italiane continued its commitment to the "Noi Siamo Qui" (We Are Here) caring initiative, aimed at supporting workers with fragility due to serious illnesses or chronic diseases with dedicated listening actions, work flexibility interventions, and the activation of business coaching paths with an inclusive approach to accompany an effective reintegration into work. The aim is to offer, among other measures, a listening Citizens", which illustrated the essential elements to pay attention to when surfing the web and also provided food for thought to increase digital awareness. The webinar is in addition to the multimedia content available on the Poste Italiane website, created to meet the different needs of users in terms of accessibility and communication methods. In fact, tools with predominantly visual characteristics such as infographics and video briefs, playful-educational narrative elements such as interactive games were created. These initiatives are part of Poste Italiane's broad programme to offer services and tools accessible to all users.

pathway to identify the main cultural, organisational and management implications of fragility conditions and, at the same time, to spread growing awareness and company proximity on the issue. Among the new services launched for the project target group, the possibility of requesting a second opinion for oncological and cardiovascular diseases was also introduced in cooperation with the Company's Medical Centre.

In December, Poste Italiane organised the first Diversity Day event "Poste Plurale Universale". The aim of the event was to share a moment of transversal attention on the inclusive path undertaken by the Company, in line with the objectives of the Group's Strategic Plan and the pillars of the Sustainability Strategy.

During the event, external guests and employees gave testimonies on the four dimensions of Diversity & Inclusion: Gender, Generations, Vulnerability and Interculturality, offering an immersive experience in diversity.

The event was made accessible to the entire corporate population in streaming, which is also accessible thanks to the presence of LIS interpreters.

In addition, an itinerary was created at the event to raise awareness among families on digital inclusion and the risks involved in building a digital identity.

A feedback questionnaire was also conducted anonymously to employees who attended the corporate event to gather ideas and reflections for improvement. Employees shared their experiences with authenticity, generosity and courage to help other participants learn about the actions implemented by Poste Italiane. Numerous positive feedbacks were received, underlining the appreciation of the initiative and the value of the inclusion pathway.

In addition, in order to ensure the re-employment of "workers in fragility condition" who were unable to work at the Company's premises in connection with the health emergency, Poste Italiane continued the Insourcing and Re-employment programme, which started in 2021.

In order to promote the psychological well-being of its employees, a new project has been set up in 2022, which will start in early 2023, a "Listening, Guidance and Support Counter", whose services include access to a dedicated platform to support people's mental well-being and offer a concrete response to challenges, changes and vulnerable situations that may arise in daily life. The platform will provide access to a network of selected psychologists and psychotherapists to undertake an accompanying pathway, and will make available various accessible content, such as various scientific tests for the self-assessment of global well-being.

In 2022, Poste Italiane promoted, for the tenth edition, the initiative dedicated to disabled children and siblings of employees, which includes two summer holiday periods of fifteen days each. Thanks to this initiative, around 40 boys and girls had the opportunity to spend time being entertained and receiving individual assistance from dedicated caregivers, thus fostering an experience of socialisation and full integration, as well as allowing families to benefit from relief in their daily care needs.

For the third consecutive year, Poste Italiane also participated in "4Weeks4Inclusion", the largest inter-company event in Italy on diversity and inclusion. Over the course of four weeks, the event involved more than 300 partners including companies, universities, associations and non-profit organisations who shared events, in presence and digitally, realising moments open to the public and thousands of social interactions. Through the initiative, the Company realised its own event on the occasion of the "Day against Violence against Women" on 25 November, entitled "Corporate Volunteering in Support of Women Victims of Violence", to show the continuity of its commitment in this area. This was followed up with a targeted editorial plan on the NoidiPoste corporate intranet. In addition, the Company, already a signatory of the Equal Opportunities Charter, joined the "European Diversity Month", a thirty-day initiative promoted by the European Commission that aims to raise awareness of the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The Company participated in the project by making an intercompany video with testimonies of people from different cultures and involved the entire company community in the "Let's Movie" initiative, through which employees were able to share their preferences on diversity and inclusion, suggesting films and TV series on stories of inclusion and respect for diversity to build a virtual commented and shared list.

As part of the promotion of diversity and inclusion, Poste Italiane further intensified its cultural awareness and training activities, including through six "Diversity Innovation Meetings", with the aim of exploring the main aspects of diversity, focusing specifically on the issues of gender equality, intergenerational alliance, vulnerabilities, interculturality and inclusive language. During these meetings, start-ups, third sector organisations and institutions were invited to share their experiences and knowledge on promoting inclusion. Following their speeches, the participants divided into working groups and discussed together co-generating ideas to be implemented in our specific reality. The initiative received positive feedback from participants for the effective interactivity and the high level of inspiration of the testimonials.

#### Poste Italiane's support to food collection

Together in the 26th edition

Among the solidarity initiatives held during the course of 2022 that saw the participation of Poste Italiane was the twenty-sixth National Food Collection Day, the initiative organised by Banco Alimentare Onlus that allows people to donate part of their grocery shopping to those in need.

The Group provided over 150 Company vehicles to transport the donated foodstuffs and employees responded positively to the solidarity day, participating both as drivers and as volunteers in the supermarkets. In just one day, 6,700 tonnes of food were collected in 11,600 outlets, a sign of trust that testifies to the value of the solidarity initiative as concrete help for the weaker sections of the population.

In December, the first functionalities of a Diversity & Inclusion KPI monitoring dashboard were released. Based on the typical processes of the Human Resources function, it analyses, by organisational function and territory, the trend of the main variables on the four Diversity aspects: gender, generations, disability/vulnerability and interculturality. The dashboard will make it possible to keep track of movement across the four aspects and intervene promptly in the event of out-of-line targets and critical situations. It will be a useful tool to accompany an ongoing and widespread awareness-raising on processes impacting on Diversity & Inclusion dimensions.

In addition, to support the focus on the Corporate Volunteering project, an inspirational streaming event was organised, extended to the entire company population, with the aim of reflecting, through external and internal testimonies, on the meaning and value of the role of a volunteer in the social area and in the Company. The event was an opportunity for colleagues to take a closer look at the activities of Corporate Volunteering and its evolutionary perspectives, with the possibility for everyone to contribute with their own participation to the new social objectives that arise and move also in workplaces and relationships from a social and community welfare perspective.

# Support for the socio-economic development of local communities

Through the implementation of modernisation and digitalisation processes aimed at increasing the well-being of citizens and the socio-economic development of the territory in which it operates, Poste Italiane pays particular attention to local communities. The Group, committed on a daily basis to the promotion of organic and widespread social inclusion initiatives, sets itself the goal of generating a positive impact in the context in which it is present and, relying on an inclusive approach and constant dialogue with citizens, institutions and Third Sector associations - both local and national - is committed to achieving this goal thanks to the capillarity of its Post Offices and the development of high-quality products and services. In addition, following a continuous process of listening to and reconciling the legitimate interests of the community, the Company pays greater attention to the most vulnerable, who are hindered by particular physical, mental, family, economic, ethnic or social conditions.

Poste Italiane's commitment is aimed at generating a positive impact throughout the country, promoting an inclusive approach and constant dialogue with citizens, in order to protect their well-being and interests in an organic and widespread manner

In order to contribute to the socio-economic development of the territory in which it operates, Poste Italiane affirms its commitment to the territory and the community within its Community Initiatives Policy.

The Policy, which highlights Poste Italiane's attention to the most vulnerable categories of people and the needs of the community, is part of the broader regulatory framework already outlined by documents such as the Code of Ethics, the Group's Integrated Anti-Corruption Policy and the Human Rights Policy. The Policy also describes the main areas of intervention by the Group for the creation of shared value in the long term, which, in line with those described in the Human Rights Policy, concern the integration of the categories most at risk of exclusion through the offer of dedicated products and services, culture and education, economic sustainability and social connection. Through collaboration with central and local governments, the Third Sector and communities, the Company involves its stakeholders by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with them, to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged groups.

Poste Italiane also contributes to the achievement of the following Sustainable Development Goals defined within the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations: to end all forms of poverty (SDG 1); to provide quality, equitable and inclusive education and learning opportunities for all (SDG 4); to encourage sustainable, inclusive and lasting economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (SDG 8); to reduce inequality (SDG 10).

#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

The Group invests for the benefit of the community in full compliance with the principles of integrity and transparency, in line with the provisions of the Code of Ethics and consistent with the values defined within the Group's guidelines. The way in which Poste Italiane grants contributions through sponsorships and donations to partners, entities, associations and institutions operating in the territory is laid down by a specific procedure governing its organisational controls. As stated in the Integrated Policy, contributions must not be exploited to conceal acts of corruption or any other conduct that is not in line with the Group's principles. For this reason, the Company's assessment of the provision of such contributions takes into account the relevance of the initiatives, the reputation of the potential partner and the alignment with the Company's objectives and expected benefits. In order to ensure the performance of activities and monitor sponsorship initiatives, the Company has a specific "Sponsorships and Product Placement" office in Corporate Affairs/Coordination and Support Corporate Affairs and Sponsorships, with a core of dedicated resources. Poste Italiane also adopted a specific "Sponsorships and Donations" procedure, which accurately regulates the process of disbursing contributions to partners, bodies, associations and institutions operating in the territory, defining specific organisational safeguards aimed at avoiding any possible conflict of interest. All requests for sponsorships and donations are evaluated by the Sponsorships and Donations Committee, which is chaired by an external President with high requirements of professionalism, integrity and independence.

Furthermore, in order to proceed with the disbursement of the contribution, an assessment is made regarding the consistency of the initiative with the contractual content, the regular performance of the activities and the correct execution of the contractual obligations.

During 2022, the Sponsorship and Donations Committee met 10 times, evaluating a total of 291 initiatives, of which 120 had a favourable outcome. In choosing the initiatives to support, preference was given to those with a significant social impact, seeking to strengthen Poste Italiane's presence in the territory, and in particular in the country's peripheral areas. The initiatives supported by Poste Italiane, in the entire country, were selected to pursue two main objectives: increase the Group's support for initiatives in the "welfare and social inclusion" category and strengthen Poste Italiane's intervention in the territory through initiatives aimed at promoting sectors related to Culture and Art on which the continuing pandemic and health restrictions have had the most serious impact.

# 291

socio-cultural initiatives approved by the Sponsorship Committee that met 10 times in 2022

{325}------------------------------------------------

In order to identify specific KPIs that measure the benefits generated by the initiatives for both the community and the business, Poste Italiane uses a monitoring tool based on the classification and measurement standard proposed in the London Benchmarking Group (LBG model), which establishes specific criteria for managing, measuring and reporting on community involvement, according to principles of transparency and participation.

In March 2022, version 8.0 of the "Sponsorships and Donations" procedure was approved to take into account the changes in the acquisition process via the website and for the evaluation of sponsorship initiatives according to the SELECT model, which had already been revised in 2021 in order to strengthen it through more robust media value calculation methods and a standardisation of the qualitative evaluation of initiatives. With the aim of transferring the algorithm and database from Excel to a more powerful software, the model uses the SELECT 2.0 tool, developed in 2021 with the support of the Digital Technology & Operations Function and integrated into Poste Italiane's systems, and fed with quantitative data provided by potential partners on the web platform. In 2022, an online form was also created to guide Sponsees through the sponsorship application process. The platform aims to ensure greater transparency and traceability, to structure and homogenise sponsorship requests from potential partners, and to make quantitative information on the initiative compulsory, which is useful for the enhancement of the SELECT model.

To help citizens in the Marche region affected by the 2016/2017 earthquake, Poste Italiane has extended until 31 December 2022 the possibility of using the 'Seguimi' (Follow Me) service free of charge. Designed to help citizens affected by catastrophic events, the service is dedicated to all those who have not yet defined their housing situation, and allows them to automatically receive mail from their old address to their new address with validity for correspondence destined both in Italy and abroad. In addition, in December 2022, Poste Italiane helped to support the community living on the island of Ischia, affected by the flood of 26 November 2022, in returning to their daily lives. The Poste Italiane office was a point of reference for the population, as well as a place to meet and gather initial information on the events that took place on the rest of the island. Poste Italiane, which acted in the front line since the day after the flood, has cleared the water and mud from the Post Office in Casamicciola, which was reopened to the public as soon as possible, so that residents could carry out all necessary financial and postal transactions, such as withdrawing pensions. In addition, the Company organised a collection service for undelivered parcels at the Ischia Porto office, to help restore normality after the flood.

#### Monitoring Seismic Movements

Poste Italiane in support of the National Institute of Oceanography and Geophysics Seismic areas such as the North East need constant monitoring of seismic movements. Poste Italiane made itself available to the OGS (the National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics) for the installation of seismographs in its buildings, taking care to find the most suitable locations both to ensure careful monitoring and not to disrupt the daily activities of its employees. The Group promptly responded to the Institute's request for seismographs to be installed in various parts of the territory for precise monitoring, making all the buildings used in the area available.

The collaboration included the initial installation of 42 seismographs, of the approximately 100 planned. So that the installation would not interfere with the daily work of the employees and to ensure their safety in the workplace, the seismographs were installed inside the rack, the structure that stores the servers and from which the telephone lines originate.

During 2022, coinciding with the dramatic events related to the humanitarian crisis linked to the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, Poste Italiane took the lead in working with institutions to support people in need.

Thanks to the cooperation with the Fire Department of the Ministry of the Interior, Poste Italiane delivered 500 sleeping bags to Ukrainian refugees accommodated in Latvia, and two radiation detectors to the embassies in Prague and Krakow, useful in the event of exposure of the population to radiation.

The Civil Defence also requested support from the Company for the correct and safe provision of a subsistence contribution for refugees: this is a measure that is paid directly to the beneficiary, for a maximum of three months and for a total amount of €900. Poste Italiane also ensured timely reporting of the contributions made. In addition, thanks to the synergy of BP, MP, MIPA and DTO, and with the collaboration of PostePay, the design of the process shared with the Civil Protection and the continuous and constant alignment between all company structures made it possible to activate the disbursement of the contribution in a very short time, so much so that the first payment was made at the end of May, while the engagement of Poste Italiane took place in April. Finally, all the problems presented, related to the tax code and cyrillic writing, were solved promptly. Thanks to the support of Poste Italiane, a total of more than 140,000 payments were made to over 30,000 refugees in 2022.

# A New Life for Small Municipalities

Poste Italiane assumes a fundamental role as a link between the country's institutions, territory and services, making available its capillarity on the territory that guarantees the country's quality of life and allows citizens to relate to the largest service distribution network, through its omnichannel offer.

Thanks to the new digital infrastructure connected to the PA, Poste Italiane is fighting the 'desertification' of small towns that have lost more than half of their residents over the past 50 years and now find themselves at risk of depopulation due to factors such as poor job opportunities, transport difficulties and the progressive reduction of services, such as bank counters and Public Administration offices. In this sense, investment in services and infrastructure is of strategic importance as it can affect the quality of life of those who wish to remain in, or return to, small towns.

The Group continues to invest in the programme, launched in November 2018, dedicated to supporting the communities of Small Municipalities, in awareness of their fundamental role in the national socio-economic dimension. The project affirms Poste Italiane's desire to establish a solid and active relationship with the territory, in order to promote specific initiatives to support the development and inclusion of under-served territories. In 2022, in continuity with previous years, the Group ensured continuity of service by maintaining an immediate and transparent dialogue with local and central institutions, as well as by involving the public in educational initiatives, from financial to digital education. Poste Italiane took into account the solicitations received from local communities regarding the risk of depopulation and decided to invest in the peripheral network by involving the local authorities, so that they could point out the needs of the territories, in order to systematise the Company's presence in local communities.

Poste Italiane also reiterated its commitment against commercial desertification in small mountain municipalities, participating as a partner in the National Assembly of Uncem Piemonte, the National Union of Municipalities, Communities and Mountain Authorities, entitled "1952-2022 - Walking Together. Entities, Territories, Communities in the Challenges of Ecological Transition and Country Unity". The Assembly, held in Rome on 13 December 2022, was attended by parliamentarians from different parties, who interacted with mayors, local administrators, businesses and university professors to discuss what territories and communities are today.

Finally, Poste Italiane closed in 2022 the experimental phase of the "Smart Letter Box" initiative, which had seen the installation during 2021 of 57 boxes with screens in the cities of Rome, Milan and Turin. By 2022, more than 400 smart boxes will have been installed throughout Italy, 300 of them in small municipalities. The testing phase was also useful to monitor and develop the management of the information collected by the boxes, which through IoT technology are able to detect certain parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and the detection of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Through the low-power e-ink screen, both environmental and logistics-related information can be conveyed. In fact, the new boxes make mail collection even more efficient and sustainable: the presence of sensors that check whether or not there is mail inside the box allows post officers to know, by consulting their hand held devices, whether the box needs to be emptied. Therefore, the benefits of the operation of the new cassettes can be found in a reduced environmental impact, since it avoids the passage of the post officer if the cassette is empty, and in increased work efficiency of the post officer himself.

#### Poste Italiane in support of local communities

The agreement signed by Poste Italiane and Unione Nazionale Pro Loco d'Italia

The core of the agreement signed by Poste Italiane and the Unione Nazionale Pro Loco d'Italia is the offer of innovative services and products to support the activities of UNPLI Pro Loco organisations. The agreement will enable the approximately 221 Pro Loco organisations in Friuli Venezia Giulia to use the services offered by the Group at advantageous conditions, thus being able to fulfil the new obligations imposed by the Third Sector reform, thanks to digital payment systems including "Codice Postepay" and "Mobile Pos Postepay". Through the "Codice Postepay" service, transactions made by framing a QR code from a smartphone can be accepted through biometric recognition and PosteID entry, without the use of Postamat or prepaid cards. The service can be used by around 29 million Postamat or prepaid card holders, 5 million of whom already have the PostePay app. The "Mobile Pos Postepay" service, on the other hand, allows mobile acceptance of transactions via Mobile POS with payment cards belonging to the circuits for which authorisation has been requested.

The agreement between Poste Italiane and Unione Nazionale Pro Loco d'Italia confirms the Group's central role in supporting not only local businesses, but also Third Sector organisations.

#### Poste Italiane at the service of the territory

The new Post Office at the Biomedical Campus in Rome On 20 April 2022, a new Post Office was opened at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico, located at Via Alvaro del Portillo 200, Rome. This is an important achievement for the benefit of the citizens of the neighbourhood: in fact, the facility serves the university campus in Trigoria, at the gates of the Decima Malafede Nature Reserve. The new service made available by Poste Italiane is part of the Campus Bio-Medico "Campus Hub" multi-service hub project development framework and is intended to integrate training, research and care facilities with socially useful public services in compliance with the criteria of innovation and environmental sustainability.

As of 31 December 2022, Poste Italiane has achieved important goals that are part of the Group's broader Strategic Plan, enhancing one of the essential resources for the Company and the country, namely the territory and the communities that inhabit it. With regard to environmental sustainability, Poste Italiane's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality targets by 2030 and thus reducing emissions and the environmental impact generated by its activities is also strengthened in relation to the initiatives undertaken by the Group to support small municipalities. In this regard, the Company aims to offer zero-emission services in 800 small municipalities and 35 historical centres by 2024.

This is the background to the ambitious "Polis Project - Digital Citizenship Service Houses", which through tools such as proximity "Single Points of Contact" aims to transform the 6,933 municipalities with fewer than 15,000 inhabitants, with at least one Post Office, by equipping them with a cutting-edge technological and digital infrastructure that enables the automation of services and the rapid dissemination of new PA digital service. The project represents a significant milestone in the fight against depopulation of small municipalities, also with a view to supporting the country's digital transition, as envisaged by the PNRR (National Recovery and Resilience Plan) and the PNC (National Plan for Complementary Investments). Poste Italiane not only strengthens the relationship with its vast customer base, but also contributes in this way to the streamlining of processes within the public administration. Some 35 million people currently use the physical and virtual counters provided by Poste Italiane and will be able to benefit from the project's advantages.

{328}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane is taking an active part in the mission to boost training, the efficiency of the public administration, and the competitiveness of the Italian production system, thanks to a specific line of action called "Polis Project", financed with €800 million from PNRR funds and a further 400 million from the Poste Italiane Group, which will involve almost 7,000 Post Offices. The Project constitutes a major social inclusion programme and comprises two lines of action: the first consists of bringing telematics services of the Public Administration inside Post Offices with the creation of proximity "Sportelli Unici" (One-Stop Shops): in the 6,933 municipalities with a population of less than 15.000 inhabitants, equipped with at least one Post Office; the second, "Spazi per l'Italia" (Spaces for Italy), plans to make 250 spaces available throughout the country, 80 of which will be activated in municipalities with less than 15,000 inhabitants, converting them into co-working spaces of small (about 100 square metres), medium (about 450 square metres) and large (about 1,500 square metres) size, all interconnected to form a single digitalised and smart network. Poste Italiane, which has already built 28 Post Offices, plans to start or complete a total of 1,500 sites by 2023.

In particular, with regard to the "Sportelli Unici" line of action, the aim is to equip the Post Offices concerned with new technologies and tools to allow, 24 hours a day, a complete, fast, easy and digital use of services relating to: identity documents, civil registration certificates, judicial certificates, social security certificates, services to the regions and other types such as, for example, the exemption from the RAI licence fee. Through the development of physical-digital access channels such as the Counter, the Totem, the evolved ATM, the Call centre and the Web channels, and thanks to the support of a special IT platform developed to deliver services in multi-channel mode, Post Offices will be transformed in order to make a widespread, concrete and resilient contribution to the achievement of the objectives that the European Union and Italy have set themselves with the "Next Generation EU" plan, in terms of digitalisation and social inclusion. In addition, the Post Offices network, thus transformed, can also be made available for the deployment of further government and PA initiatives on connectivity and cloud services. Specifically, the line of intervention envisages the installation of 4,000 self-service columns for the use of public utility services, 7,000 evolved ATMs for the provision of services to citizens, 500 lockers for the use, 24 hours a day, of mail, parcel, e-commerce and public utility delivery services, and 4,000 interactive digital shop windows for communication with citizens. In addition, the Project also envisages the implementation at Post Offices of interventions aimed at environmental sustainability and social growth of communities. In particular, the following will be installed: 5,000 electric vehicle recharging stations available to the Group's delivery fleet, which will be made entirely green, and to local communities; 1,000 photovoltaic systems that will help reduce CO2 emissions; smart building systems and environmental monitoring sensors; 1,000 outdoor spaces equipped to host cultural, health and wellness initiatives. In addition, by providing the possibility to access public administration services from a One-Stop Shop, citizens' journeys and the consequent congestion of roads and public offices will be reduced, allowing the reduction of CO2 emissions.

The objective of the second line of intervention is to create the most widespread, digitalised, accessible and immediately available co-working network in the country: workstations, meeting spaces, shared services, areas dedicated to events and training whose use will be open to private individuals, companies and the public administration, universities, and research centres with which service agreements can be defined to best meet the needs and vocations of each type of stakeholder. The national co-working and training network will be able to offer interested administrations and local stakeholders physical locations where they can test innovative solutions of broadband-supported services dedicated, for instance, to distance learning, health, safety, becoming an essential partner for the transformation of services and the acceleration of economic and social growth. The network, which is based on the transformation of important Poste Italiane office buildings and large Post Offices entirely made available to the Project, will also be an important reference point for the innovation of small and medium-sized enterprises and for the enhancement of cultural and natural assets, being present in various industrial districts and in the areas of greatest cultural and tourist attraction.

The Polis Project covers an area where approximately 40 million people reside, or 65% of the Italian population. In this regard, Poste Italiane has estimated that in the first six years of operation, the Polis Project will generate a positive impact on the community and the environment worth a total of €380 million, of which 348 million will be for road safety and the reduction of traffic and waiting times, and 32 million for the reduction of polluting emissions. The Group also estimated an impact generated by the Project over the investment period 2022-2026 and the operation of the Post Offices until 2031 of €1,061 million in terms of GDP and €484 million in terms of the distribution of labour income, for a total of 18,600 jobs created.

Finally, the Polis Project generates significant impacts throughout the territory, also with a view to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Gender equality (SDG No. 5); Clean and affordable energy (SDG No. 7); Decent work and economic growth (SDG No. 8); Enterprise, innovation and infrastructure (SDG No. 9); Sustainable cities and communities (SDG No. 11); Combating climate change (SDG No. 13); Life on earth (SDG No. 15); Peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG No. 16).

{329}------------------------------------------------

With reference to Poste Italiane's achievements in providing support to small municipalities, the following should be mentioned:

# Cresco Award "Città Sostenibili" (Sustainable Cities) 2022

In keeping with Poste Italiane's mission to represent, with its widespread network of Post Offices, a link between institutions, the territory and the country's services, in 2022 the Group once again took part in the CRESCO AWARD "Città Sostenibili" (Sustainable Cities) award, promoted by the Sodalitas Foundation in collaboration with ANCI (National Association of Italian Municipalities), under the patronage of the European Commission and the Ministry of the Environment, an initiative that aims to reward the commitment of Italian municipalities to the sustainable development of their territories.

The Company awarded the prize "For the sustainable development of small municipalities" to the municipalities of Marene (CN) for "Marene: may their example become Culture - 10 years of the Municipal Library of Marene", Tornareccio (CH) for "Pallano: origins and evolution" and Acireale (CT) for "Space Music". The projects and programmes being developed in these places will contribute to creating virtuous styles and behaviour in sustainable development.

# "Valori ritrovati" (Rediscovered values): a project of circular economy

In continuity with the Memorandum of Understanding stipulated with Caritas in 2018, and renewed in 2019 for a further 5 years, the initiative "*Valori ritrovati*" (Rediscovered Values) continued in 2022, a circular economy project that aims to allocate the so-called "anonymous parcels" or "abandoned parcels", to families in need, through "Empori della Solidarietà", a circuit of supermarkets managed by Caritas that provides basic necessity products free of charge. The objective of this collaboration, which reinforces the Company's presence in promoting local development through initiatives of inclusion and social solidarity, is to recover abandoned parcels destined for waste, for the benefit of those most in need.

More than 120 tonnes of abandoned parcels have been recovered by Poste Italiane - with the support of its employees, who participate as volunteers - in the course of this circular economy project, with a total economic value of more than €500,000. Approximately 35,000 anonymous or abandoned parcels have been delivered to Caritas every year since 2019, thus fostering the culture of reuse.

{330}------------------------------------------------

### Corporate Volunteering

Promoted in the context of social responsibility, corporate volunteering represents an ethical choice of the Company and a concrete commitment to the community, in line with the values and principles stated in the Code of Ethics and the Sustainability Policies. This commitment has been reaffirmed with the Group's adoption of an internal procedure called "Defining, developing and monitoring corporate volunteering initiatives", which is consistent with the Poste Italiane Group's Sustainability Strategy, and which identifies the strengthening of corporate volunteering as a means of creating a network of solidarity in the area and strengthening the collaborative capacity between people by fostering the development of social networks that can bring long-term value to the Company, consolidating its reputation in terms of social responsibility. The ultimate goal is to make a significant impact on society by creating virtuous volunteering.

The definition of activities to promote corporate volunteering and fundraising for social projects in compliance with Poste Italiane's Code of Ethics, is part of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in February 2022 between Poste Italiane and the Forum of the Third Sector, aimed at promoting the development of inland areas through targeted projects and services and to encourage the re-employment of the most vulnerable people. The memorandum of understanding, which leverages Poste Italiane's widespread territorial distribution, is aimed at the creation of a corporate volunteering platform, through which the 100 national member organisations of the Forum, representing over 158,000 territorial branches, can present projects in which Poste Italiane employees can take part as volunteers, outside working hours.

Moreover, the protocol envisages Poste Italiane's participation in shared events and initiatives organised by the National Forum of the Third Sector, thanks also to the support of a permanent discussion table with the Forum, in line with the Group's stakeholder engagement policies, by providing information material on Poste Italiane's tools and products dedicated to the Third Sector and communities. Similarly, the Forum is committed to participating in the activities and events organised by Poste Italiane, with the aim of disseminating knowledge of the incentives managed by the Company among the non-profit entities belonging to its organisation, in order to facilitate their use by the associated organisations. The Forum can also avail itself of the technical support of Poste Italiane in defining proposals for public finance interventions to support Third Sector organisations.

# Close to young people

In continuity with previous years, Poste Italiane is supporting the digital transformation path in collaboration with the academic world. After last year's meeting with around 100 students from the master's degree course in Data Science at Rome's La Sapienza University, who were the protagonists of the initiative promoted by the Data Science Industrial Liaison Program (ILP), Poste Italiane continued its path of bringing together Italy's most important industrial realities and the students of the degree course at the same university. The objectives of the ILP include identifying opportunities for internships or final projects for students, including presenting the latest industrial products for big data management and analysis, and explaining their use in the development of innovative solutions for business and the Company. In general, the aim of the initiative is to introduce students to the labour market, showing them opportunities in large companies such as Poste Italiane, a company with the highest number of employees in Italy.

March 2022 also saw the conclusion of the "Future Lab" project, which had already started last year. The initiative was aimed at the children of Poste Italiane employees between the ages of 16 and 23, who set out to find out what path to take in their future. The aim of the project was to support boys and girls in their study choices, bringing them closer to the world of work in a more conscious manner, to undertake paths in line with their skills and passions and to learn about the main market orientations on future professions.

In 2022, the School4Life 2.0 project, aimed at combating high school drop-outs, continued. The initiative involved 133 schools, 15,000 students from all over Italy and 11 major companies, including Poste Italiane, with the co-ordination of Consel Consorzio ELIS, a non-profit training organisation that brings together more than 100 large groups and SMEs. School4Life 2.0 consists of school and career guidance, in the awareness that socially responsible companies should take charge of the younger generations, accompanying them towards a professional future through a structured link between school and business. The aim of the project is to give young people a more direct insight into the world of work and a greater awareness of their own potential. The lines of intervention, which made up the project in 2022, were: project-based teaching approach with technical interventions by corporate figures; motivation and inspiration through role models and corporate mentors; training on topics such as the SDGs and Agenda 2030; bringing the female population closer to STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). The Company experts with their testimonies trained over 530 young people from 14 schools nationwide.

Finally, Poste Italiane promoted ten special projects to support children and young people with fragility and their families, included in the wide-ranging social action plan "Presenti sul territorio, vicini alle comunità" (Present in the territory, close to the communities). The package of actions in support of children was realised in collaboration with ten non-profit organisations of national importance selected by Poste Italiane. The spirit of the initiative and the details of the ten educational, recreational and training projects were illustrated during a meeting in the presence of the Chair of Poste Italiane, Maria Bianca Farina, the Joint General Manager, Giuseppe Lasco, and representatives of the 10 non-profit programme partners: Canovalandia, Fondazione Don Rigoldi, La Caramella Buona, Associazione Italiana Cuore e Rianimazione "Lorenzo Greco", Le Ali dei Pesci, I Bambini delle Fate, Associazione Andrea Tudisco, Dynamo Camp, Fondazione Theodora and Be&Able.

{331}------------------------------------------------

#### Hires

Poste Italiane to support young people

Poste Italiane was able to take advantage of the recovery following two years heavily marked by the health emergency by enhancing, in continuity with previous years, the employment of young people. In 2022, the Group continued to actively promote a recruitment campaign aimed at young people and recent graduates, recruiting around 3,700 people under the age of 30, well over twice as many as in the previous year for the same category of new hires.

Poste Italiane recognises the value of younger resources in facing the new challenges emerging in an increasingly digitalised and changing environment. Moreover, the Company, aware of the competitiveness that characterises the world of work today, considers it essential to offer young people a work opportunity that allows them to explore their skills and express their potential, confirming its commitment to supporting the development of the community in which it operates.

# Dialogue and transparency in relations with the authorities

The Group's capillary presence in Italy and its desire to act as an intermediary between institutions, the territory and citizens, implies maintaining a constant and proactive dialogue with public decision-makers and collaboration with all national and local institutions, in order to generate a system-wide benefit that extends to the entire community and not just those directly involved in the process.

Specifically, dialogue with authorities and institutions can be a useful tool for public decision-makers in assessing the impact and possible consequences of the introduction of a given piece of legislation, both with a view to preventing problems and creating opportunities, as it allows them to identify the Company's position with regard to particular issues of legislative relevance.

In addition to guaranteeing the effective delivery of services to citizens, the satisfaction of the social needs of the community and, at the same time, increased competitiveness and business continuity, Poste Italiane aims to maintain a positive and constant dialogue with the institutions in order to encourage the sharing of projects for the development of the territory.

The Group collaborates with central institutions, such as the Government and Parliament, to represent corporate interests and promote shared socio-economic development projects in the interest of the community.

The institutional activity carried out is therefore developed along two lines:

- z towards the Group, ensuring the protection of corporate interests and supporting business development by monitoring the institutional framework, assessing the impact of regulations, identifying risks and opportunities, the preparation of texts and positioning documents with the specialist functions and the representation of requests to institutions;
#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

- z towards institutions, actively contributing to the institutional dialogue through an ongoing discussion on issues of relevance to the country system, consultation on the impact of regulations in the relevant markets, the provision of supporting information and knowledge and partnership for project development.
The analysis of the impact of regulations is necessarily supported by institutional dialogue aimed at clarifying and exploring the application aspects of a given regulatory provision, also through the presentation of proposals aimed at supporting specific business needs, in order to mitigate or prevent specific risks. In this regard, during 2022, steps were taken to ensure the protection of the interests of the Company and the Group by monitoring the measures under review and regulatory provisions that, if approved, would be critical for the various business areas with loss of revenue or increase in operating costs for the Company.

During 2022, regulatory interventions mostly focused on the drivers of innovation and digitalisation, which are fundamental for the country's strategic progress, for the accessibility and functionality of services offered to citizens and for the connection with the business fabric and the Public Administration, as well as for the provision of cutting-edge technological solutions.

400 meetings with local administrations during 2022

The activities aimed at the management of institutional relations, and more specifically the legislative activity and the representation of interests, are governed by the procedure "Release of information and management of relations with institutional sub

{332}------------------------------------------------

jects", which is periodically reviewed and updated on the basis of the evolution of the system of relations and the corporate organisation. The actions to be implemented, the effectiveness of which is measured downstream by the proposing business and/or corporate functions, are supported by assessments of the expected benefits, which are subsequently represented in periodic reports describing the scope of the initiatives undertaken in economic, commercial and governance terms.

Collaboration with local institutions is intended to foster the sharing of development projects in the area, as well as to identify shared solutions aimed at accompanying corporate reorganisation processes with attention to the specific features of the various territories, in order to foster the most effective service delivery to citizens, the satisfaction of the community's social needs and, at the same time, the enhancement of competitiveness and business continuity.112 The promotion of dialogue with representatives of local institutions is necessary for the Company in order to stimulate knowledge and sharing, and to prevent possible critical issues in relation to the Group's activities. In particular, the emergence of negative impacts may take the form of critical situations with institutions or negative media coverage. The management of these impacts takes place through territorial oversight and the appropriate central structures, through an internal analysis aimed at analysing the characteristics of the various criticalities. In order to share the internally agreed solution between the heads of the Institutional Relations structures and those of the Business Units involved, this process is being reported on, and is supported by the implementation of an institutional database for the integrated management and archiving of applications, reports and contacts. In addition, in order to measure and verify the actual quality of the actions undertaken, quality and quantity indicators are used on a monthly and quarterly basis included in analyses of global reports and managed on a comparative basis across geographic areas and in comparison to previous years. This reporting is based on meetings by macro-topic and on weekly and monthly developmental analyses of engagements with institutions, in relation to requests received. Approximately 400 meetings with local administrations were organised during the reporting year.

An effective dialogue between Poste Italiane and consumer associations began in 1999 and grew over time, until the first Framework Agreement was formalised, signed in 2011 and renewed first in 2014 and then in 2018. The following are the primary objectives of the agreement:

- z constant improvement of the quality of Poste Italiane's products and services;
- z transparency and fairness of the Company's relations with consumers;
- z improving consumer knowledge of products and services;
- z information for the correct and conscious use of products and services and for the dissemination of the instrument of joint conciliation.

The Framework Agreement also established the Cantiere Consumatori, a regular monthly consultation with representatives of the Associations aimed at presenting products and services and explaining them in detail.

A further objective of the relationship with the associations is to follow up the Conciliation procedures, also provided for in the Agreement, for the amicable settlement of disputes for all areas of the Company's activities. Finally, also on the basis of the Agreement, which lays down the principles for transparent cooperation and information sharing for the benefit of customers, the newsletter "Dialogue with Consumers" was established.

Constant and transparent relations with consumer associations continued in 2022, therefore, on the basis of the Framework Agreement, the Consumer Forum and the newsletter "A dialogue with consumers". Topics include the repricing of the BancoPosta account, the new mailboxes distribution plan, and the public consultation launched by AGCom, the Communications Guarantee Authority, on the subject of compensation in the postal sector. On the subject of training, a new course for conciliation experts was organised during the year, as well as 8 local refresher training meetings at the Bologna and Landriano hubs. Finally, on the topic of antifraud, four thematic webinars were held, organised in cooperation with CERT. This activity is regulated and described by the Company procedures pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 and by the procedures defined on the basis of the Framework Agreement entered into between the Company and Consumer Associations, referred to in the procedures pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001. The success of the policies adopted is verified and evaluated in relation to the lack of critical interventions by consumer associations in the media, both at national and territorial level.

Relations with consumer associations at central level are managed by the "Relations with Trade and Consumer Associations" function, which consists of a manager, four resources in the Rome office and one in the Milan office. On the other hand, relations with consumer associations at the territorial level, in particular with regard to Retail Postal Conciliation procedures, are managed in connection with the territorial offices of the function. The objectives of the function, which are included in the MBO of the managers in charge, are measured by analysing the discussion questions by assessing the percentage of questions conciliated, i.e. concluded with an agreement with the consumer associations, in relation to the total number of questions discussed. Conciliation procedures are governed by the "Retail Postal Products Conciliation" Procedure, updated in 2021 and drawn up in cooperation with several consumer associations.

Among the main central institutions and regulatory and supervisory bodies with which Poste Italiane interacts are: the Italian Communications Authority (Autorità per le Garanzie delle Comunicazioni - AGCom), the Ministry of Economic Development (Ministero per lo Sviluppo Economico - MISE),

<sup>112.</sup> Poste Italiane is a member of Confindustria (Confederation of Italian Industry) on the basis of a specific agreement that has been renewed on a multi-year basis since 2005. This agreement regulates membership procedures, the benefits deriving from the status of associate and the definition of the contribution regime. The agreement for the three-year period 2020-2022 envisages, among other things, strategic initiatives aimed at promoting a new corporate culture involving business models and choices geared towards innovation and economic and social sustainability. For the association year 2022, the membership fee stands at €3.2 million.

the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze - MEF), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Ministero per gli Affari Esteri e la Cooperazione Internazionale - MAE) and the European Policies Department of the Cabinet Office.

In particular, as part of its relations with the MEF, on 20 February 2020, Poste Italiane's Board of Directors approved the renewal of the three-year agreement for 2020-2022, which aims to regulate treasury services and the movement of funds on behalf of the State.

Furthermore, on a European and international level, Poste Italiane maintains relations with the European Parliament,

Financial inclusion

NFS

Based on the experience gained in previous years in relation to the Covid-19 health emergency, which emphasised the value Poste Italiane places on people, especially in times of difficulty, the Group maintained its commitment to ensuring that its products and services are also available to those who cannot easily access them. Thanks to its extensive network, the Group was able to stay close to the community also during 2022, a year further affected by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Poste Italiane supports the protection of the rights of local communities in order to ensure the accessibility of its products and services to those territories and categories of users who would otherwise not be able to access them, as set out in the Company's Policy on the Protection and Safeguarding of Human Rights. At the same time, the Company undertakes to promote initiatives aimed at disseminating and supporting the the European Commission, the Universal Postal Union (UPU), PostEurope, the European Center of Employers and Enterprises providing Public services (CEEP), the International Post Corporation (IPC), together with other institutions and associations in the sectors in which the Company operates. The Group is involved in the coordination, representation and monitoring of the political agenda, both at European and international level, within the above-mentioned bodies. In addition, the Group is engaged in the release of information for regulatory purposes at national, European and international level, as well as in the preparation of proposals for amendments and additions to the relevant legal and regulatory framework.

#### Poste Italiane's offering

The expansion of the Group's services in 2022 During 2022, Poste Italiane maintained its commitment to an all-round sustainable future by expanding its range of offerings with the introduction of new services. In this regard, the Group promoted, like in the previous year, the "risparmiosemplice" (simple savings) formula. The Savings Plan, which can be subscribed to at any Post Office by holders of a BancoPosta current account or a Post Office Savings Booklet, has an indefinite duration with a periodicity defined by the customer, and is based on the 4-year postal savings bond issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA. By subscribing to this bond within the Savings Plan, it is possible to periodically set aside amounts - even small ones - in order to build up capital over time, with the possibility of also making additional subscriptions. The sums deriving from the maturity of Postal Savings Bonds, subscribed under the Plan itself, will be automatically reinvested in the "risparmiosemplice" Savings Plan and, in addition to the capital invested, also include the accrued interest, net of tax charges. In addition, the postal savings agreement with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, renewed in 2021, offers the Group a sustainable remuneration over the four-year period 2021-2024, with an annual fee for collection targets of between €1.6 and 1.85 billion.

A further service, launched in November 2022 in cooperation with Banca Aidexa SpA, is the "Prestito BancoPosta Business Link Online", which allows digital loans to be offered to sole proprietorships and small businesses. In the area of insurance services, on the other hand, the mixed life insurance product "Poste Progetto Dinamico Bonus" was launched, with a duration of 15 years, aimed at combining a performance-linked insurance project with unit-linked insurance investment components. In addition, the new "Digital Protection" feature of "Poste Vivere Protetti" has been included in the modular offer. Through PostePay's omnichannel platform, the Group has assumed a strategic role in the provision of payment services, reaching a number of "Evolution" cards of almost nine million and more than 23 million users who have adopted PosteID to certify their digital identity.

The Group monitors its initiatives and its range of products and services by promoting continuous and structured dialogue initiatives, such as the annual dialogue with key stakeholders. The purpose is to monitor the needs of the community and the degree of satisfaction with the products and services offered. Poste Italiane uses principles of seriousness, reliability and elasticity in providing dedicated offers to all categories of customers to whom it caters, also on the basis of specific needs.

Furthermore, the Group maintained the program to relaunch postal savings, guaranteeing the improvement of the quality and efficiency of the services offered to customers, also through the implementation of the digital channel. In particular, online operations on BancoPosta current accounts for the purchase of Buoni Fruttiferi Postali were guaranteed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In addition, the variety of the Postal Savings Bond catalogue and the possibility of subscription also online make it possible to meet the various needs of consumers. Among the aforementioned Bonds, the following are noted:

- z the 4X4 Bond, the interest of which, fixed and increasing, accrues at the end of each four-year period from the date of subscription and, after 4, 8 and 12 years, is also recognised in the event of early redemption;
- z the 3X4 Bond, with interest, fixed and increasing, accruing at the end of each three-year period from the date of subscription and, after 3, 6 and 9 years, is also recognised in the event of early redemption;
- z the 3X2 Bond, with interest, fixed and increasing, accruing at the end of each three-year period from the date of subscription and, after three years, also recognised in the event of early redemption;
- z the 3-Year Plus Bond, with a term of 3 years, provides for the capital invested and interest to be recognised at the end of 3 years;
- z the Ordinary Bond, the interest on which is fixed and increasing and is paid after one year from subscription and every two months thereafter. It is possible to request redemption at any time, within the statute of limitations, the return of the invested capital and, one year after subscription, also the accrued interest;
- z the Sustainable Savings Bond, which pays a fixed return and the possibility of earning, at maturity, a premium linked to the performance, if positive, of the STOXX® Europe 600 ESG-X index;
- z the Renew Bond, dedicated to those who have redeemed an Interest-bearing Postal Certificate that expired after 20 September 2022 and within the placement period of the Renew Bond. It has a term of six years, with interest, fixed and increasing, accruing at the end of each three-year period from the date of subscription and after three years being recognised even in the event of early repayment;
- z the Inheritance Solution Bond, dedicated to beneficiaries of an inheritance procedure concluded in Poste Italiane, recognises a certain yield at the end of the four-year period.

In order to encourage the use of the digital channel by all citizens, also taking into account the experience gained during the emergency period, Poste Italiane encouraged several communication campaigns aimed at promoting the online operation of postal savings. In order to encourage its customers to manage their postal savings online, the Company offers a wide range of services available through digital channels, ranging from displaying balances and movements for holders of a "Libretto Smart" or "Ordinario" to the management of the "Libretto Minori" by parents, from the subscription of dematerialised postal savings bonds to the transfer of money between books and BancoPosta current accounts, to the recharging of Postepay cards and the association of IBAN to the book. As of 2022, the Group also made it possible for the legal guardian to carry out online transactions with the "Libretto Minori".

With a view to digital and financial inclusion and in line with the country's objectives, Poste Italiane has confirmed its considerable contribution in Italy in providing digital identity to citizens, the Public Digital Identity System (SPID) which aims to provide users with a single login system with which to access all the services of the Public Administration. During 2022, more than 6 million new digital identities were activated and more than 1 billion accesses were executed through this system. It is also possible for younger people to request activation of the digital identity: parents or guardians of minors can request activation of the SPID by accessing their personal area and managing access authorisations.

# Financial and digital inclusion of seniors and young people

Poste Italiane is constantly seeking innovative solutions aimed at reducing the digital divide and increasing financial inclusion, with a particular focus on the most fragile and at-risk groups, supporting and sustaining the different population groups within the communities in which it operates.

With regard to the issue of financial inclusion, the Group promoted, in continuity with previous years, financial education initiatives to enable citizens to train and inform themselves, so as to be able to make informed choices in financial matters.

In addition, Poste Italiane periodically updates the page of its website dedicated to Financial Education, publishing new content, video briefs and useful tools for users to become more aware of their financial, insurance and pension needs and to better orientate themselves among the various solutions with the support of a financial advisor. Financial Education events, run live by experts, aim to explore the importance of proper financial education and its usefulness in everyday life for oneself and one's family members.

#### Poste Italiane participates to "*Mese dell'Educazione Finanziaria*"

The unknowns linked to the international scenario and rising inflation force us to act with foresight, and financial education can be a key tool to face and overcome this period of crisis. With this in mind, Poste Italiane is at the forefront of the country and is aware of the need to strengthen and systemise initiatives aimed at increasing the financial, insurance and pension knowledge of Italian people. During 2022, the Group participated in the fifth edition of the "Mese dell'Educazione Finanziaria" (Financial Education Month), #ottobreedufin2022, the largest Italian event on financial education, established and promoted by the "Comitato per la programmazione e il coordinamento delle attivita di educazione finanziaria - Comitato Edufin" (Committee for the planning and coordination of financial education activities - Edufin Committee) with information and awareness-raising activities and events on financial, insurance and pension.

An interesting new feature introduced this year, shared with the Philately Department and the MEF, is the philatelic initiative dedicated to the event, which includes a philatelic postmark available in all 487 Post Offices with philatelic counters and in the 10 Philately Spaces from 1 October and throughout the month, and the weekly distribution of 5 postcards with contents inspired by the "Moments that Count" described on the Edufin Committee website.

With the aim of enhancing the economic and financial knowledge of students at all levels of school, in order to educate them in active and aware citizenship, the multi-year initiative "Il Risparmio che fa scuola", promoted by Poste Italiane and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, continued. This project offers a completely free, unique and original educational path, aimed at training the

citizens of the future, leading them to reflect on their own economic, environmental, energy and food saving behaviour, and on how much these can affect everyone's life and that of own community.

Until its natural expiry date, June 2022, the project delivered the initiative's training content only through digital channels, updating the dedicated portal www.ilrisparmiochefascuola. com in such a way as to facilitate the use of all the materials present (training sheets for teachers and students, thematic videos, games for children). In this way, the project continued to contribute to the education of students on topical issues such as basic economics, savings and the valorisation of all resources.

In 2022, the Company continued to expand its offering of financial inclusion products in the 'green' sphere aimed at young, senior and new Italians. In this regard, the Postepay Green prepaid card, voted Product of the Year 2022, is dedicated to 10-17 year olds, and is made of biodegradable material, with 82% polylactic acid of organic origin. The Postepay app allows to access to an innovative payment system, share expenses with other Postepay Green holders, and purchase tickets for transport.

With regard to Payments and Mobile services, PostePay's range of products and services is designed to allow access in an inclusive manner to all categories of users, such as new Italians, young people, students and seniors. In particular, the main products and services offered are:

- z Western Union APN service, which allows to easily send money online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to over 200 countries and territories using a Postepay prepaid or debit card enabled for the service. The recipient can also withdraw cash at a Western Union agency, and can choose in which currency, among those available, make the payment for sending money to certain countries;
- z Postepay Digital, an electronic money tool that aims to improve the customer experience with a focus on simplifying the processes of selling and using the prepaid card through the Postepay app, a single and simplified access point to the world of payment and mobile services offered by PostePay SpA, with over 21.7 million downloads.

In addition, PostePay aims to improve knowledge and usage of the products through constant attention to the information available on the used channels, in particular through the content on the institutional website and FAQs.

#### The Digital Education project

In continuity with 2021, Poste Italiane promoted the Digital Education project, with the aim of fostering the acquisition by citizens, customers and businesses of digital skills in order to consciously and safely seize the opportunities arising from the technological transformation. The initiative, which is part of the company's broader programme as a guide for citizens in the development of knowledge and increasing skills between technology and innovation, aims to provide users with an overview of technological and digital innovations through dedicated multimedia content and free webinars.

# Transfer of the tax credit

In line with previous years and confirming the support offered by Poste Italiane at the national level, the Group continued to offer tax credit transfer during the course of 2022. The service, which will be launched in autumn 2020, allows citizens and businesses with a BancoPosta account to transfer their tax bonuses and obtain liquidity in one go. The service can be requested online on the poste.it website using internet banking credentials or in all Post Offices, and the request process is simple and immediate. It is also possible to view the value of credits in real time, using a simulator available both on the website, in the public section, and at the Post Office.

Following the interruption of the tax credit transfer service due to the successive anti-fraud regulatory changes enacted by the Government, on 7 March 2022 Poste Italiane reopened the platform for the purchase, subject to the availability of the sums on the Revenue Agency platform, of tax credits deriving from building works. Since the anti-fraud rules enacted by the government limit the use of the service for taxpayers and businesses, the transfer of the credit through Poste Italiane is restricted to those who have directly incurred the "Bonus casa" charges. Since the platform has been reopened for first transfers only, at the moment, Poste Italiane does not purchase any tax credits that have been the subject of a previous transfer, including tax credits accrued as a result of invoice discounts.

In 2022, Poste Italiane was honoured as a Sustainability Leader thanks to its socially responsible behaviour.

Leaders of Sustainability is the list of the 200 Italian companies awarded as most sustainable created by "Il Sole 24 Ore" in cooperation with "Statista". The ranking was drawn up following a complex process of research and selection of companies, and the evaluation criteria were determined according to independent criteria. Specifically, the intensive research is based on the analysis of a total of 40 indicators in the three areas of sustainability: environmental, social and economic. The data are searched in the sustainability report (or an equivalent document) and in annual reports or financial statements for 2020 or 2019. Subsequently, the data collected is aggregated and evaluated and scored and each company receives a total score in the three areas. The 200 companies with the highest final score (the maximum score being 100) are named Sustainability Leaders.

# Environmental impacts of real estate facilities

Poste Italiane attaches particular importance to environmental protection, aware of the need to use resources responsibly in order to minimise negative environmental impacts and pursue sustainable development aimed at creating value for the community and the territory in which it operates, in full implementation of the Group's Code of Ethics.

By adopting a conscious approach to the use of energy, water resources and waste management, Poste Italiane aims to generate a positive impact for the community in which it operates, following a path aimed at the green transition of its activities

Supporter of the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures (TCFD)

In 2021, Poste Italiane became an official supporter of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures), committing to climate-related disclosure to help create a more resilient financial system. This action reinforces the Group's willingness to align with national, European and international environmental and energy objectives, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.113

In this regard, to ensure the compliance of the Group's activities with current regulations on energy use, Poste Italiane entrusts the management of the processes of monitoring, measuring consumption and identifying sources of savings to a single corporate function, which oversees the areas of environmental responsibility related to the Group's real estate assets.

Consistent with previous years, in 2022, Poste Italiane maintained its commitment to environmental protection, promoting initiatives aimed at reducing its environmental impact, in pursuit of the Group's ESG objectives.

Notable actions implemented by the Company include the management of utility contracts with the purchase of commodities from 2023 directly in wholesale markets, the gradual replacement of endothermic vehicles with electric vehicles and the installation of charging stations for electric vehicles. Considering the monitoring of environmental impact as a functional element for a green conduct of its business, the Group is constantly renewing its commitment to install data collection

tools and management platforms to control consumption and utility bills. In addition, Poste Italiane has promoted energy efficiency through an increase in the production of renewable energy and has fostered the reduction of emissions through dedicated projects including: planting initiatives, installation of consumption data collection tools, promotion of internal team development dynamics and conscious behaviour in the use of energy by employees.

As of 2019, Poste Italiane has adopted an Environmental Sustainability Policy, which allows it to identify the Principles and initiatives on environmental sustainability towards which to direct its commitment and action. This Policy is also a useful tool to formally communicate to stakeholders the green approach of the Group's business model, with reference to logistics, transport and property management activities.

The Policy consists of several Principles, which define how Poste Italiane acts in the area of environmental sustainability. Specifically, the issues covered in the document concern resource efficiency, innovation to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, the reduction and prevention of the environmental footprint and the promotion of an environmentally conscious culture.

Over the years, as a demonstration of the willingness to reduce the environmental impact of its activities, Poste Italiane has achieved certification of the environmental management system for the companies Postel SpA and SDA SpA, and has held since 2020 the certification of the environmental management system for the processes of design, direction, control and coordination of Postal and Financial Services according to the international standard UNI EN ISO 14001. The certification was issued by IMQ-CSQ, one of the most authoritative accredited certification bodies at international level.

In order to improve the Group's performance with a view to efficiency, Poste Italiane has developed an Environmental Management System compliant with the ISO 14001 standard, which represents a key tool in the systemic management of environmental issues, with reference to business processes. In order to support its improvement objectives, the Company promotes actions and interventions aimed at reducing the impacts linked to the performance of its activities, as well as initiatives aimed at raising awareness of environmental protection and respect issues. In this sense, the Environmental Management System provides valuable technical support to achieve Poste Italiane's sustainability goals.

Specifically, in order to achieve the objectives and Principles set out in the Environmental Sustainability Policy, Poste Italiane has identified three areas of intervention, for

<sup>113.</sup> During 2022, the Company did not incur any fines or penalties linked to non-compliance with environmental regulations.

{341}------------------------------------------------

each of which a number of specific actions are envisaged, detailed below:

#### z Reducing the environmental impact of its operations:

- optimisation of energy consumption and reduction of atmospheric emissions generated by buildings, thanks to renewable energy supply plans and investments in energy efficiency solutions, such as theconsumption constant control systems, the use of eco-efficient lighting systems and other energy-efficient electrical/electronic devices;
- encouragement of green transport for logistical activities and individual mobility, with the aim of reducing atmospheric emissions, also by providing employees with a company fleet of hybrid or fully electric vehicles;
- decrease in the consumption of materials and correct waste management, specifically through the reduction and containment of paper consumption, achieved thanks to the dematerialisation of documents and through the maximisation of the share of waste that can be recycled/ reused;
- reduction of water consumption.
- z Incorporation of environmental aspects into the products and services offered:
	- implementation of digitalisation processes for the products and services offered, as digital innovation can create shared value between Poste Italiane and its stakeholders, providing a valuable contribution to the reduction of the environmental footprint and to corporate profitability;
	- analysis of environmental risks and opportunities with regard to investment choices and the management of insurance activities, in order to contribute significantly to Italy's sustainable development path.

#### z Raising the awareness of employees and third parties regarding the environmental culture:

- involvement of employees in programmes and initiatives regarding the natural environment and ecology, in particular also through the support and active participation of Poste Italiane's corporate volunteer network;
- support for training and information projects on environmental issues, as well as initiatives aimed at protecting and restoring the environmental heritage;
- dialogue and collaboration with bodies and associations operating at national and international level, in order to design and adopt models, policies and strategies that can mitigate climate change and hinder the inefficient consumption of resources;
- analysis of risks and environmental management methodologies adopted by counterparties (suppliers, business partners, other companies) in supply processes and possible extraordinary finance operations.

Numerous initiatives demonstrate Poste Italiane's commitment to environmental sustainability. In this regard, we highlight the projects to increase energy production from renewable sources through the development of photovoltaic solutions and those to absorb CO2 and other climate-changing emissions through the planting of green areas on the Company's land and buildings are highlighted.

The effectiveness of the approach adopted is constantly monitored through procedures for identifying and assessing risks inside and outside the Group, also referring to the dialogue with stakeholders and the systems for reporting violations and sanctions.

In accordance with reference regulations, Postel SpA and SDA, the two companies primarily involved in the certification process, have also defined specific environmental policies.

Occupational Health and Safety, Environment and Quality Policy of Postel SpA: the Policy aims to ensure and monitor appropriate business conduct in compliance with regulatory and legislative requirements on environmental issues, aligning the Company to the required standards in the field of occupational health and safety. In addition, Postel SpA defines its objectives with regard to environmental protection and prevention of negative impacts, with particular regard to efficient waste management, and its commitment to the responsible use of resources and the protection of biodiversity, relevant to its context.

Quality, Environment and Occupational Health and Safety Policy of SDA SpA: through this Policy, SDA SpA establishes and presents the principles relating to the proper management of quality, environment and occupational health and safety issues. In particular, the Company recognises the importance of environmental sustainability, committed to the protection of the environment and making specific reference to the prevention of pollution and excessive consumption of natural resources that may result from the activities carried out within the Company. With this in mind, SDA SpA promotes the recycling and, where possible, the reuse of the waste produced, and is committed to the constant pursuit of a supply chain based on sustainability.

{342}------------------------------------------------

For Poste Italiane Group, the decarbonisation strategy relating to property management is a sustainable choice, also in view of the effects on energy prices caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

In this regard, in July 2022, Poste Italiane opened a new photovoltaic power plant in Palermo, capable of satisfying the equivalent of one year's energy consumption of as many as 250 homes. This is only the latest of the major environmental sustainability measures implemented by Poste Italiane in the Region of Sicily. Despite the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic crisis has dramatically altered the timeframe for the commissioning of the system, due to the restrictive regulations applied across the country, Poste Italiane, with its 769 Post Offices and 122 delivery centres in Sicily, has embarked on a path that will lead it to achieve zero net carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. The Company launched five parallel projects in Sicily, investing in LED, photovoltaic and other technologies. The first plan of interventions includes the replacement of classic lighting fixtures with LED fluorescent lamps to reduce electricity consumption by around 50%, and over 9,000 installations have already been carried out on 378 sites on the island. Lighting systems, along with air conditioning systems, are also part of a "smart building" project involving an integrated, timed and remotely controlled in-building consumption management system. Through an integrated management of the systems, as well as their replacement and modernisation, 200 Post Offices in Sicily are currently working to achieve an average consumption saving of 15% for the electricity component and 10% for the gas component, according to the "energy efficiency" plan for air conditioning, electrical and lighting systems. Green areas have also become central to the Company's operations. The fourth project, which involved 12 locations, involved the conversion of old underground heating fuel tanks into water collection systems for new or existing trees and hedges planted in areas outside the buildings.

The photovoltaic plan was also implemented, with the installation of panels at 39 Sicilian sites capable of producing around 3 million 700,000 kWh a year, equal to the annual energy supply of more than 750 homes (with traditional 3 kW meters).

#### Poste Italiane's green strategy

Energy requalification

Poste Italiane in support of the Passo Varano sorting centre

Poste Italiane has undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure that its buildings are increasingly sustainable. One of the relevant initiatives in Central Italy was the reclassification of the Passo Varano sorting centre in the Marche region. The centre underwent a major energy upgrade, with a view to decarbonize the buildings.

Specifically, work was carried out on the conditioning system. The system, consisting of a gas-fired central heating plant and cooling units, has been replaced by more modern and less impactful electric heat pumps, which, thanks to their state-of-the-art technology, have better energy performance and are also less harmful to the environment in the event of gas leaks.

The Group is aware that energy efficiency is crucial to succeed in combining economic growth and sustainable development. Therefore, in adopting an exemplary environmental behaviour, Poste Italiane bases its strategy on the following areas of intervention:

Renewable energy sources. Poste Italiane promotes the installation of photovoltaic panels in its buildings, located throughout Italy, in order to make the impact of its activities even more sustainable. The renewable energy project envis-

ages the development of around 300 photovoltaic plants on flat-roofed property sites totalling 18MWp and around 25 GWh/y of expected production when fully operational. In addition, in 2022, 96 realisations were completed with progressive networking of plants.

The initiative has a two-year duration and started in the first half of 2021, with a total investment of €31.5 million, of which €16.5 million in 2022.

Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reductions achieved through building energy efficiency initiatives

{343}------------------------------------------------

In addition to the approximately 25 plants built between 2009 and 2020, which now produce over 1.5 GWh per year, the new investments are aimed at building by the end of 2023 around 300 medium/large-sized plants that will cover all regions with one of the most significant interventions in Italy in recent years, certainly representing the most widespread initiative ever carried out in the country. This intervention will create a production capacity of 18 MW with a projected annual output of 25 GWh, equal to around 6% of current consumption, progressively leading to the connection of the first 9 MW of photovoltaic power to the national grid. The best practices for this type of plant are: the Padua Sorting Centre with 1,300kW of power that will be completed within the year, the Milan Roserio plant with 524kW and the Palermo Sorting Centre with 858kW completed and soon to be connected to the national grid.

Smart buildings. Confirming the Group's commitment to environmental protection, in continuity with previous years, the Smart Building project was promoted for the creation

tonnes of saved carbon dioxide thanks to the energy efficiency initiatives implemented

of a management system for Poste Italiane's medium-small sites by monitoring consumption, climatic conditions inside and outside the buildings, and the automatic implementation of regulation and management systems for air conditioning, heating and lighting systems. The project, financed by the European Investment Bank, envisages the implementation on 2,000 Poste Italiane buildings of a Building and Energy Management System (BEMS) with a unique platform of integrated plant supervision, management and control aimed at optimising maintenance management and energy efficiency. The intervention includes both the installation in the buildings of sensors and plant control and monitoring systems, and the connection to a centralised platform that allows the progressive optimisation of plant and room management. With thousands of buildings scattered in every climatic zone and at every latitude and altitude in Italy, Poste Italiane is fully representative of the extreme diversity of climatic conditions that characterise the territory in which it operates. For this reason, the Company needs technical solutions that can be adapted to different conditions and that can optimally manage the comfort of environments for both staff and customers, in an attempt to use as little energy as possible and make the best possible use of the systems, so as to reduce breakdowns and increase the service life of the systems. More than 1,600 locations, mainly Post Offices and delivery centres, are already connected to the BEMS platform and therefore, efficiently managed and monitored remotely, also through the implementation of a dedicated Control Room, and the expected electricity saving is about 7.6 GWh/year when fully operational. By 2022, more than 950 additional locations were installed, in addition to the progressive improvement of the Software of the BEMS platform, also shared with some professionals in the area. During the year, more than 1,600 sites were installed and on-boarded on the supervisory system, despite some difficulties in the procurement of materials, with an investment of €6.5 million, of which more than 3 in 2022. The project is scheduled to be completed during 2023, with an overall target of approximately 2,000 locations.

energy efficiency projects conducted on the territory, focused on reducing consumption (gas and electricity) and emissions

Energy optimisation. With regard to energy efficiency, Poste Italiane has started installing gas and electricity meters in the Company's main buildings, in accordance with the provisions of Legislative Decree 102/14, and expects the gradual completion and use of measurement data also for the new series of energy diagnoses by 2023.

In continuity with previous years, in 2022, Poste Italiane planned a series of measures aimed at achieving lower resource consumption, in particular for the heating and cooling management of its buildings. The levers that are used are manifold and range from the renewal of end-of-life installations with more efficient equipment to the renovation of buildings to improve thermal efficiency, as well as revise the heating and cooling modes by switching from vectors such as oil to natural gas, to electrically powered heat pumps. Again, interventions are carried out according to technical parameters renewed year by year by the "Gestore dei Servizi Energetici - GSE" (Energy Services Manager) which indicate the types of solutions that qualify for incentives for the increased efficiency of installed equipment. Approximately 270 interventions were completed in 2022.

As part of the so-called "green project", between 2020 and 2022, the decommissioning of diesel tanks no longer in use and their conversion into water tanks capable of collecting rainwater to be used for the irrigation of newly planted trees will be carried out at 81 locations.

In addition, the Company launched an energy efficiency project aimed at optimising the air-conditioning and heating systems at some of the Group's structural sites for more than 40 interventions and an investment budget of approximately €3 million in 2022.

{344}------------------------------------------------

21.7 mln€ invested in projects to reduce emissions

LED lighting. In 2022, Poste Italiane's commitment to the use of smart technologies continued. Over the years, the Group has installed LED lighting systems. In particular, more than 30,000 new LED light fixtures were installed in over 500 buildings in 2022.

Encouraging virtuous behaviour. Poste Italiane, which has always been committed to promoting increasingly efficient and sustainable management of its operating processes, pays particular attention to the issue of reducing the waste produced, initiating and maintaining projects for the "virtuous" reuse of goods and equipment/equipment deemed obsolete, but which can still have a "second life". These initiatives, such as "Valori Ritrovati" promoted in cooperation with Caritas, consist in removing certain goods and equipment from the waste management cycle by handing them over to third parties for reuse. Poste Italiane also participates in numerous initiatives aimed at raising awareness on the rational use of energy, such as "Ora della Terra", "Sustainability Survey", "Libera il Tuo Talento", "M'illumino di meno". Finally, the Company launched the "Green Challenge" initiative in 2022, a path aimed at encouraging Poste Italiane's customers to adopt appropriate behaviour in the area of sustainability.

Like in previous years, the Group participated in the customary celebration of Earth Day, the world's most important event for environmental protection, established by the UN in 1970. The 52nd edition held in 2022 focused on accelerating the search for solutions to combat climate change in a collaborative effort between citizens and governments around the world. At the end of the day, a memorandum with 52 tips for reducing environmental impact was published.

During the day, special attention was paid to the education of the youngest. To this end, the "Festival of Education for Sustainability" was again proposed, designed to bring children closer to green issues. In addition, during the TV marathon #OnePeopleOnePlanet, which in recent years has replaced the "Earth Village" organised by the Focolari Movement at Villa Borghese, a moment was reserved for the youngest, for the stories of young people from all over the world and their commitment to the planet, also with the presence of guests, artists and schools. The event concluded with the awarding of the #Iocitengo contest: the project aimed at stimulating the awareness and active participation of children and young people in solving the global challenges undertaken by nations with the 2030 Agenda, through the creation of projects such as artwork or reportage.

By participating in this event, the Group reinforces the validity of its corporate strategy, which aims to integrate sustainability into all areas of the Group's business, with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.

#### Green Month

Poste Italiane pays attention to environmental sustainability issues

In continuity with previous years, Poste Italiane organised the "Green Month" on 20 April 2022, in order to strengthen the focus on the Group's sustainability, also by joining international awareness campaigns. The initiative lasted 30 days, useful for working on the culture of good environmental protection practices through a number of appointments. Commitment to the environment is one of the pillars of Poste Italiane's Sustainability Strategy, and developing a culture of concrete actions in our daily lives is the real challenge the Group needs to face in order to make a real contribution to the planet.

Below is Poste Italiane's Green Month decalogue for 2022:

# GREEN MONTH DECALOGUE POSTE 2022

become powerful pollutants, draws attention to the issues of reuse, recycling and the circular economy, which are cornerstones of Poste Italiane's Sustainability Strategy and which also find concrete expression in other company initiatives.

The Group has promoted numerous initiatives in different fields, from sustainable mobility to land valorisation, such as: 'M'illumino di meno', 'Earth Hour', 'Sustainability Monitor Report' to promote a conscious approach to environmental issues and to reach the carbon neutrality target set for 2030.

Demonstrating the Group's concern for the environment, the Company promotes the consumption of certified and recyclable products with respect to internal and external printing and consumables. In this regard, the procurement of consumables, such as original and remanufactured consumables, reams of paper, packaging, and the supply of labels, forms and cartons, incorporates, where applicable, the Minimum Environmental Criteria (MEC) set forth in Article 34 of Legislative Decree 50/2016. In addition, specific product certificates/eco-labels conforming to ISO 14024 are used.

Consistent with the Group's commitment to the use of recyclable materials, a project has been launched to replace traditional credit cards with cards made from sustainable materials, such as the new Postepay Green, produced in biodegradable material and composed of 82% polylactic acid of biological origin. Moreover, Poste Italiane confirms its focus on environmental sustainability policies through the use of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified paper and transparent cellulose and biodegradable material for envelope

made of biodegradable material, 82% polylactic acid of organic origin

windows. Specifically, the use of FSC-certified paper for the Group's mass printing plants ensures the procurement of this material through a value chain that guarantees environmentally friendly, socially useful and economically sustainable forest management.

For some time, the Group has paid special attention to the social and environmental aspects of its supply chain management, in the belief that the development of transparent and long-lasting relationships with suppliers, paying utmost attention to quality, respect for the environment, safety and social 

{346}------------------------------------------------

implications in the procurement process, are useful principles for constantly improving the service offered to its customers, as well as for pursuing a public interest objective for Italy's entire economic system. The aim is to pursue sustainable change through the definition of projects with a significant impact, such as logistics, decarbonisation of buildings and consumables, favouring a focus on resource exploitation, investment plans and technological development, together with the greening of more traditional needs.

For the planning and preparation phase of tenders, the Sustainable Procurement Model adopted by the Group envisages a differentiated approach that, on the one hand, encourages sustainable innovation of materials and processes also with a view to the Circular Economy, and on the other hand, verifies and proposes the possible reference to the general framework of Green Public Procurement (GPP - Green Procurement of the Public Administration) recommending the use of KeyESG applicable to the individual procedure, taking into account the maturity of the reference market, the role in the supply chain and the business size of the economic operator. Specifically, KeyESGs represent the non-financial criteria for assessing a company's performance, measuring its sustainability in environmental, social and governance terms.

The upward trend in environmental, social and governance indicators is matched by the significant increase in the ESG incidence of the technical offer, recorded at over 6 percentage points compared to last year. In order to increase the effectiveness of business processes and the competitiveness of the supply chain, Poste Italiane aims to encourage the adoption of ESG criteria for selecting, evaluating and monitoring suppliers, mitigating any ESG risks.

Like in previous years, Poste Italiane has implemented the criteria set out in GPP, in order to combine sustainability in terms of reducing environmental impacts and cost rationalisation, applying, where required, the indications on the MEC, established with specific Ministerial Decrees. Tender procedures with technical offers (OEPV) almost always include ESG criteria.

Poste Italiane promotes the supply of foodstuffs of BIO, IGP, DOP, sustainable fishing, etc. products, which are higher than the minimum quantities prescribed by the MEC. Therefore, even local suppliers involved in the supply chain of food products for canteens and bars are required to guarantee certified products.

Furthermore, in order to significantly reduce its environmental footprint, the Company has embarked on a path of eliminating plastic of the canteens since 2019. In this regard, the register of suppliers is developed through a qualification system for regional areas and territorial areas. By favouring the presence of local labour with a zero-kilometre supply of material in the process of awarding works contracts, especially for those involving building and plant works, Poste Italiane is able to keep procurement costs low while reducing its impact on the environment.

# Poste Italiane's entry in the market of selling energy to Italian households

The Poste Italiane Group's entry into the electricity and gas sector was accompanied by the "Energia160" promotion, through which the Company provided a discount on electricity and gas supplies for its employees and pensioners. The transparent and completely green offer was introduced in honour of Poste Italiane's 160th anniversary and includes the supply of both gas and electricity for users. The pillars of Poste Italiane's "Poste Energia" electricity and gas solution, aimed at the free market and available at all Post Offices, on poste.it and on the Postepay and BancoPosta apps, are: transparency, predictability and sustainability.

In terms of how the offer works, the price of the raw material for electricity and gas is locked in for 24 months, and there are two payment options: the traditional one, with a variable amount based on how much is consumed in the month, and the fixed instalment option, which is calculated on the basis of the previous year's consumption. This innovative solution allows the customer to pay the same amount per month for 12 months, and thus plan energy expenses in the household budget. At the end of the year, the instalment is recalculated for the following year, upwards or downwards, on the basis of the actual consumption recorded.

In line with the Group's philosophy, "Poste Energia" is a transparent, predictable, innovative and sustainable service that strengthens the relationship of trust between citizens and the Company. The service represents another step along the path defined in the Strategic Plan, and contributes to the strategic objectives of a multi-platform company with a diversified business consisting of postal and logistics services, finance, insurance, payment, telephony and, from now on, energy.

# 100% green Electricity and gas offers

In addition, the "Poste Energia" offer is distinguished by its focus on environmental sustainability, with particular reference to conscious consumption. In fact, the Company is committed to guiding the customer towards good practices in the use of the service, aimed at limiting its consumption. Furthermore, the electricity sold comes 100% from renewable sources produced in Italy and the carbon dioxide emissions of the gas released for consumption are fully offset. Finally, "Poste Energia" is easy to subscribe to, simply submitting a recent bill, minimising paper consumption.

The supply of electricity and gas expands the multi-channel offer of services already offered by the Group, from postal services to financial services, from insurance to digital payments, from telephony to fibre Internet connection and other services. The approach adopted by the Group is based on reliability and transparency, maximising the predictability of customer spending and using 'pull' commercial channels, which differ from 'push' channels in that they are activated by customers 

{347}------------------------------------------------

according to their own will, and do not prompt them to make a choice that is not always conscious or correct.

Through this new service, Poste Italiane intends to take a leading role in the country's energy transition path, while at the same time developing an advanced digital customer experience, relying on the widespread network of Post Offices close to the territories and people.

## Waste Management

Among the Group's environmental sustainability strategies is the continuous reduction of waste produced in all activities, the use of products with less impact on raw material consumption, the increased focus on the life cycle of materials used and the reduction of packaging. Most of the waste produced by Poste Italiane is non-hazardous waste such as paper, cardboard and plastic packaging and wooden pallets. However, within some sites the production of special waste classifiable as special hazardous waste, such as containers of printing inks or ink waste, may originate, albeit residually. In this regard, the Group is constantly committed to the gradual elimination from the purchasing cycle, also through the adoption of CAMs, of the products and materials that at the end of their life cycle give rise to the production of hazardous special waste, favouring similar but more sustainable products. Special waste is sent for recovery/disposal under liability cycle contracts that the Company enters into with authorised companies, in compliance with the requirements concerning the handling and traceability of waste as set out in Legislative Decree 152/2006 and the like (e.g. forms, loading/unloading register, MUD). The share of recyclable waste is instead sent for recycling/recovery through asset transfer contracts. This activity currently includes the recycling/recovery of paper and cardboard, plastic, wood and, partially, iron ore.

Waste management is a critical issue for the Group, and consists of planning, monitoring and control processes. The following are also mentioned among the sensitive activities referred to in the organisational model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01, including those relating to the management of waste that should arise as a result of the adoption of special protective or organisational measures to oversee extraordinary situations arising from exogenous factors (e.g. health emergencies), with reference to the definition of appropriate behavioural and organisational rules and related control measures.

Poste Italiane ensures the constant assessment of impacts and the implementation of countermeasures also through the precise definition and identification of roles and responsibilities within its organisations. The responsibilities of the Company's various organisational structures with regard to activities that influence waste management and, more generally, environmental impact issues, are documented in the organisational structures and specified in the activity declarations therein. The verification of the conformity of the processes related to the correct management of waste is constantly carried out through the control of the technical and professional suitability requirements of the suppliers of the collection and recovery and disposal service, through the control of service levels and through controls on the correct management of operational processes within the sites. The plant-structural audit activity carried out at the sites also includes verification of the conformity of the waste management processes produced, with particular reference to the correct management of collection points, temporary storage, separation by type and the processing and keeping of the required documentation (Forms, MUD, etc.). In addition, the Group has undertaken initiatives aimed at raising awareness on the issue of waste management, especially at sites where proper separation and disposal are an added value in terms of recovery/recycling possibilities.

Control over the proper performance and management of the waste collection and recovery/disposal service is carried out by verifying:

- z the correct supply of various types of containers for the temporary storage of waste;
- z the labelling of waste/containers;
- z the execution of the planned waste movements;
- z that the waste management documentation has been completed correctly;
- z compliance with the limits for temporary storage;
- z transport by suitable and authorised means;
- z valid registrations and authorisations for transporters and disposers/recoverers.

Finally, with the aim of planning actions for continuous improvement in waste management, a risk and opportunity assessment is carried out within the framework of the adopted Environmental Management Systems. The criteria used are established according to the specifics of the activity performed. To this end, the following are therefore determined:

- z risk and opportunity scenarios for environmental impacts and relevant internal and external factors, and consistent with compliance obligations;
- z the business processes/functions concerned;
- z the assessment of likelihood, impact and level of control;
- z the classification of risks;
- z risk mitigation and control measures;
- z the level of inherent and residual risk;
- z new interventions and actions to be implemented.

Actions implemented to address risks and, where possible, seize opportunities, are proportional to the impact of waste production according to site and type, and monitoring of waste production data is carried out both within the specific procedures/methods referred to in the Environmental Management System, and during periodic reporting, such as the preparation of annual activity reports.

In particular, in 2022, the Environmental Management System, adopted and certified according to ISO 14001 at the Roma Eur headquarters, was extended to all sites throughout the country with a number of employees greater than 300. The 

{348}------------------------------------------------

main Group companies have also adopted an Environmental Management System, certified according to ISO 14001, which includes procedures and operating instructions to establish guidelines and operational processes for the management of identified environmental aspects/impacts.

#### Water resource management

As regards the water supply of the sites owned by Poste Italiane, this is carried out by withdrawal from the national water network and is mainly used for sanitary purposes, with discharge into the municipal sewage system. The Group's objective is to minimise the use of water resources by monitoring their overall consumption and to minimise the volume of water resources to be disposed of as industrial waste by monitoring their production.

With regard to the activities of Postel SpA, water is taken from local aqueducts or from wells for which it has a concession, for use mainly in connection with activities similar to domestic use or for air conditioning systems. Only at the Melzo and Pomezia sites, water is used for industrial purposes, and waste from industrial processing is delivered to disposals. In contrast, water that can be assimilated to domestic water or rainwater is discharged in accordance with local concessions.

With reference to the activities of SDA SpA, the water supply of the sites comes mainly from municipal aqueducts and

# Environmental impacts of logistics

Aware of its capillary presence within the country and the potential contribution it can make in reducing environmental impacts, Poste Italiane Group considers these issues a priority in carrying out its activities, as well as in the process of defining its Sustainability Strategy.

In order to generate a positive environmental impact with regard to logistics activities, the Group aims to support the green transition of its fleet

Like in previous years, in 2022 Poste Italiane continued to implement sustainability initiatives, with particular reference to reducing the environmental impact of the corporate fleet. In this regard, 11,409 alternatively fuelled vehicles (electric, natural gas and LPG) are already deployed in the fleet.

The Fleet Renewal Plan, which had already been activated in 2019 with the aim of replacing the entire fleet of vehicles used for the delivery of postal products with green vehicles, continued in 2022 through measures to reduce energy consumption, lower atmospheric emissions, increase safety and increase load capacity for delivery. In fact, in addition to increasing safety parameters by replacing two-wheelers with three- and four-wheelers, electrically powered vehicles

only in 3 of these is water derived from wells used. Water use is mainly for sanitary purposes, bathrooms and cleaning. In addition, the water supply for the Rome hub, Milan and Bologna sites is provided by a rainwater harvesting system, which is used to irrigate the adjacent green areas, while in the leased sites the activity is completely managed by the lessor.

With regard to consumption monitoring, Poste Italiane uses an integrated quality/environmental/safety management system certified according to ISO 14001:2015. In particular, a Meter Reading Register is compiled monthly at the SDA SpA premises, where water consumption readings are recorded. These data are collected centrally to calculate the total annual consumption and the average daily consumption. On the basis of consumption, through an ad-hoc indicator called "WCI" (Water Consumption Indicator), it is possible to relate consumption to productivity, i.e. 'litres/shipping'. Subsequently, a ranking is drawn up that highlights which locations have high and excessive consumption, in order to check for abnormal situations. The objective of SDA SpA is to keep within the standard of the average value of the WCI indicator, with the aim of reducing the WCI by 5%. The quantities of water resources used and discharged in the manner described in the concessions of the various water resource sites are reported to the local administrations, which then carry out the prescribed analyses. Suppliers using the water resource, contracted under Group agreements, manage the resource in accordance with the local contracts and concessions of the various sites where they operate.

#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

have been increased in order to promote 'green mobility'. With regard to improving the organisation of the delivery load, Poste Italiane also introduced larger and more functional vehicles for the transport and delivery of parcels, and set up new fittings.

Improving the environmental performance of the Group's fleet generates significant impacts on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, Poste Italiane demonstrated its commitment to pursuing the plan for the complete renewal of its vehicle fleet, increasing the green component of the fleet itself, through the introduction of electric and hybrid cars and motorbikes in line with ESG targets of a 40% reduction in emissions. The results of this policy are evident, as the Company has gone from 11% green vehicles in 2016 to 37% in 2022, more than doubling this percentage by 2021, with the aim of replacing the entire company fleet with low-emission vehicles by 2024, resulting in a CO2 reduction equal to that of around 80,000 trees.

In line with the Group's objectives aimed at the efficient use of renewable sources and the rationalisation of energy consumption from fossil fuels, since 2018, the Company has been promoting and supporting the new plan for the green 

{349}------------------------------------------------

-18% PCL fleet emissions compare to 2019

evolution of the corporate fleet and the Joint Delivery plan, two key corporate strategies for achieving the objectives set in terms of environmental sustainability. Through the "Joint Delivery" plan, Poste Italiane adopts a model that allows the Group to radically reorganise the delivery network and its operating model, implementing a delivery style that provides for the transition from a single network structure to a structure with two networks, which differ in terms of delivery methods, frequency and type of product managed. The Fleet Evolution Plan and the Joint Delivery Plan reduce both the number of kilometres travelled for delivery activities and the need for a marshalling fleet itself.

Regarding the details of the green fleet transformation project, in 2022, Poste Italiane completed the fleeting of 1,956 electric vehicles, of which 1,170 cars, 264 vans, and 511 tricycles and quadricycles, 7,003 hybrid electric or methane vehicles, and 6,154 low-emission vehicles.

37%

of the fleet consisting of green vehicles

The green fleet reached 37% of the total Poste Italiane fleet in 2022: there are about 7,500 bifuel vehicles between cars and vans - well above the approximately 2,800 in 2021 - and over 3,600 low-emission motorbikes. Specifically, 15,113 low-emission vehicles were fleeted in 2022: 1,956 electric vehicles including 1,170 cars, 264 vans and 511 tricycles/ quadricycles; 7,003 hybrid electric or natural gas vehicles; 6,154 low-emission vehicles. The total number of environmentally-friendly vehicles introduced as of 2019 is 22,610, and by 2023, a further 3,710 environmentally-friendly vehicles are expected to be introduced in the fleet, including: 2,250 electric vehicles; 684 hybrid electric or natural gas vehicles; 776 low-emission vehicles, a total of 26,320 environmentally-friendly vehicles by the end of 2023. The interventions are in line with the goal of reaching 27,800 vehicles by 2024.

# The Green Delivery Model

#### Benefits:

- about 4 million passages saved and about 495,000 km avoided
- avoided emissions of 53 tonnes CO2eq and 244 kg of air contaminants
- each parcel delivered avoided the emission of 5.3 grams of CO2eq and air contaminants

Through the "Green Delivery" delivery model, the Poste Italiane Group has made a proximity network available to the territory, which guarantees greater flexibility for customers and, at the same time, generates environmental benefits.

Poste Italiane customers, in fact, can make use of both the PuntoPoste network (consisting of more than 15,000 pick-up points such as tobacconists, bars, stationers, newsagents, Kipoint shops, Carrefour, API and lockers) and the Post Office network for the delivery of parcels, as an alternative to home delivery.

This delivery model also allows for greater efficiency in Poste Italiane's logistics as more parcels can be delivered to a single collection point, thus limiting the number of pick-ups and fleet movements.

In the course of 2022, through the PuntoPoste network and Post Offices, around 4 million parcel deliveries could be avoided, resulting in savings around 495,000 kilometres by the Italian Post Office fleet.

The journeys saved and kilometres avoided thanks to the Green Delivery model avoided the emission of 53 tonnes of CO2eq and 244 kg of air pollutants into the atmosphere (i.e. COVNM, NH3, SO2 , NOx , PM10, PM2.5).

In particular, each parcel delivered through the Green delivery model resulted in a saving in CO2eq emissions and air contaminants of approximately 5.3 grams.

{350}------------------------------------------------

Poste Air Cargo

The first flight with environmentally sustainable fuel

On 30 May 2022, an experimental flight was carried out on the Bari-Brescia-Bari route using SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, derived from waste oil of biological origin.

The use of environmentally sustainable fuel for the Poste Air Cargo fleet is the proposal of the "Green Fuel" project for Poste Air Cargo, presented by a team of Poste Italiane employees as part of the "Insieme 24 SI" initiative, the contest of ideas on the eight pillars of the environmental sustainability strategy. The fuel used was obtained from a mixture of conventional fuel and green fuel - SAF - obtained from sustainable resources such as waste oils of organic origin, e.g. used cooking oil.

Thanks to the dilution of traditional fuel with SAF, it is possible to save around 35 kg of CO2 for each hour of flight, as SAF fuel allows for a significant reduction in CO2 emissions.

As of January 2019, the Group used the 'Fleet Management' function, set up for the purpose of indicating, managing and organising corporate strategies in the vehicle sector. This function has the task of defining and ensuring the governance, guidelines and appropriate tools to obtain the best services for the entire vehicle fleet of Poste Italiane and Group Companies.

In addition to all the stable sustainable mobility initiatives, Poste Italiane is taking steps to influence people's current and future behaviour, so that it becomes part of a new normality for the benefit of environmental protection.

# Sustainable mobility

Poste Italiane's main initiatives

{351}------------------------------------------------

# Home-Work Travel Plan 2022

Sustainable Mobility Actions Poste Italiane believes that the management of systematic movements of its employees is a key element capable of producing positive effects, both direct and indirect, on the relationship with key stakeholders that can be enhanced.

The environmental impact generated by home-work trips is one of the main indicators of the effectiveness of the Home-Work Commute Plan (PSCL). Year-by-year monitoring allows not only to report on the current situation, but also to estimate the emission trend caused by systematic corporate mobility.

The PSCL is aimed at reducing private vehicle traffic and identifying measures to direct the homework journeys of employees towards sustainable forms of mobility alternative to the individual use of private motor vehicles, on the basis of an analysis of employees' home-work journeys, their mobility needs and the state of the transport offer in the area concerned. The PSCL also defines the benefits that can be achieved through the implementation of the measures it envisages, assessing the advantages both for the employees involved, in terms of travel time, transport costs and comfort, and for the Company adopting it, in economic and productivity terms, as well as for the community, in environmental, social and economic terms. According to current legislation, the observation is aimed at territorial offices with more than 100 employees in municipalities with a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants. The results allow the savings of tonnes of CO2 emissions and the total economic value of the external costs avoided in the home-work journeys of staff.

The circulating car fleet is surveyed through the aggregated results of the survey conducted in 2022, where specific information was requested on the private vehicle used for home-to-work travel. Specific data on the composition of workers' car fleets were also obtained. The single cluster of analysis, which makes it possible to associate the number of private vehicles used by employees with the corresponding emission factor, consists of the intersection of three pieces of information from the survey: Cylinder Capacity, Euro Class and Power Supply.

Objectives related to the reduction of CO2 emissions are the focus of the joint venture agreement between Poste Italiane and sennder, a European leader in the digitalisation of freight transport. Through the partnership with sennder, the Group wants to improve the efficiency of long-distance road transport, covering the entire full-load transport sector and the handling of parcels and letters between all the Group's sorting and distribution hubs.

# Poste Italiane in Green Postal Day 2022

Together to combat climate change

Poste Italiane participated in the fourth edition of the "Green Postal Day", an initiative organised by the International Post Corporation to enhance the contribution of postal operators to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the global combat against climate change. Poste Italiane is in fact committed, together with the major players in the logistics sector, to the development of a more sustainable economy and society, through deliveries with ever lower carbon dioxide emissions. The postal operators' commitment resulted in an annual reduction of more than 30% in collective pollutant emissions and 30% in electricity consumption by 2022, compared to 2008. Companies participating in Green Postal Day also reduced their aggregate electricity consumption by more than 17.5 terawatt/hours.

The initiative promoted by the postal sector emphasises the importance of collaboration with a view to exchanging best practices and stimulating individual companies to go beyond their initial targets. The use of a common measurement system has also fostered transparency and guided sustainability choices.

This initiative contributes to the achievement of the objectives of the "2024 Sustain & Innovate Plus" Strategic Plan, in particular, those related to the decarbonisation of the corporate vehicle fleet in view of the zero-emission target set for 2030.

{352}------------------------------------------------

With particular reference to the supplier selection process, Poste Italiane also includes the use of specific criteria to monitor the indirect environmental impact. Specifically, the Company verifies the technical and professional suitability of its suppliers by requesting, for qualification purposes, the possession of specific requirements, including composition and type of vehicles in the fleet. In particular, in relation to the vehicles used to perform the services, the Group requires their consistency with the European standards on polluting emissions with a class no lower than EURO6 and that the XL boxed or tarpaulin semi-trailers equipped with TIR cable are equipped with GPS detection capable of transmitting all the detections on the position of the vehicles.

As regards the purchase of logistics services, Poste Italiane maintains conduct consistent with sustainability issues, selecting and rewarding suppliers in line with the environmental, social and governance issues that the Group promotes. In particular, for transport services there is a score that rewards eco-sustainability for suppliers who adopt vehicles with lower CO2 emission classes.

Compliance with the reference MEC is also required for footwear and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). In addition, bids aiming at the recyclability of packaging are emphasised in terms of the technical score awarded. In line with the services mentioned above, in the procurement of technological systems for parcels and letters, offers with low energy consumption in use are valued.

Poste Air Cargo, the Italian leader in full-freighter air transport, connects 8 Italian airports with a night-time network to serve the cargo courier segment logistics support of Poste Italiane. As far as the airline fleet is concerned, the rules of the UE Emission Trading System (UE ETS) stipulate that annually, by April 30th, companies covered by the greenhouse gas emission reduction scheme including airlines - must surrender a sufficient number of ETS allowances to cover their emissions for the previous calendar year.

The price dynamics for 2022, influenced by the current socio-economic context, are characterised by stable quotations, with an average CO2 price of about €81, significantly higher than in 2021, which was about €54. Poste Air Cargo, in line with the Group's green strategy, has launched a specific feasibility study aimed at identifying the possible and most suitable actions to be taken to contain greenhouse gas emissions directly attributable to air transport.

# Quality and Customer experience

Customer satisfaction is a central objective of the quality policies of the Poste Italiane Group, which is committed to its pursuit by favouring moments of listening, which are essential to ensure the continuous improvement of the quality of the products and services offered. Offering customers a unique and distinctive experience is all the more important in such a rapidly developing and evolving environment, characterised by the increasing presence of mobile devices, social networks, e-commerce and multichannel. The correct approach within these channels enables a solid relationship of trust to be established and any changes in customer habits and behaviour to be intercepted.

Values such as courtesy, transparency, fairness and impartiality, which regulate the approach adopted by the Group towards its customers, are enshrined in the Code of Ethics and ensure correct, healthy and profitable management of customer relations.

Customer focus is the primary objective of Poste Italiane which, by offering a high level customer experience and a service based mainly on understanding and listening, succeeds in intercepting the needs of its customers, satisfying their requirements with great quality and professionalism

In this regard, the Company engages in a dual monitoring process, which allows for constant improvement of both the quality delivered and the quality perceived by the customer. With regard to the quality delivered, the Company monitors its targets and progress thanks to a KPI system that covers the entire range of products and services offered by the different business units and provides management with progress and trends based on a periodic reporting system. In the course of 2022, the development of the connected experience was pursued more intensively, whereby the 'connection' between customer ratings, operational performance and competitor results was initiated. As far as Post Offices are concerned, the

Private Market structure has activated a process of continuous monitoring of waiting times through the tool of the waiting manager, which also allows timely intervention through an alert system. In addition, the Post, Communications and Logistics (PCL) structure monitors and measures on-time delivery levels for mail and parcels, and first delivery success for parcels, using digital tools that contribute significantly to increasing quality and service delivery.

In connection with the value the Company places on the quality perceived by customers, a customer experience target has been set for 2022 for recipients of the MBO (Management by Objectives) programme as well. Therefore, a dynamic model has been developed that has the ability to determine targets by taking into account the changing environment through the analysis of internal and external signals, as well as to incorporate management's possible drive for ambitious growth in strategic areas through top-down improvement. Thanks to the development of the target setting methodology, Poste Italiane is able to identify, within each macro area of the Group, the relevant components for the measurement of Customer Experience, to cover all significant interactions with customers. Moreover, considering the increasingly integrated and central role of Poste Italiane's Partners in the definition and development of the various service components, a structured project was launched to listen to Partners and customers of third-party networks, in line with the Group's perceived quality model.

With the aim of pursuing continuous improvement of the customer experience and the quality of the service offered, the Group adopts a listening model aimed at identifying priority actions to be implemented. Specifically, Poste Italiane analyses verbatims (spontaneous customer responses on critical areas encountered during the customer journey with Poste Italiane products and services) obtained on the basis of periodic surveys in relation to the Group's ESG objectives. These opinions are then translated into Net Promoter Score terms, i.e. the extent to which customers are satisfied enough to

Poste in Pratica is the new service aimed at public administrations and citizens for the delivery, control, digitalisation and dispatch of administrative files. Administrations implementing the agreement can use the widespread network of Post Offices for the delivery and dispatch of files of any type, or request home collection. For Poste Italiane, this is a solution designed to simplify processes, streamline the administrative process and reduce the delivery/receipt time of paperwork with the public administration.

The citizen wishing to send a file is informed directly by the administration about the possibility of using the service and then, once the relevant documents have been prepared, can go to the Post Office. The operator, after recognising the customer, verifies the completeness of the data entered by issuing an acceptance receipt and initiates the document at the Group's administrative service centres. After verification, the file is dematerialised and then sent directly to the PA, either in paper or digital format. The citizen using the service can also monitor the status of the file and make use of Poste Italiane's assistance channels.

recommend the products or services themselves to others. On the basis of this, the business units identify critical issues to be addressed and direct their own improvement actions, which are delivered by each owner within the Company for implementation.

83% of customers say they are satisfied (engaged) with the Group's services

The continuous listening model is ensured by the Customer Feedback Management (CFM) service, a corporate service activated for the provision of surveys on the quality perceived by customers with respect to the Group's products and services. The tool makes survey results available in real time, thanks to the use of a performing semantic engine. Indeed, Poste Italiane is working to become an ecosystem platform for the delivery of innovative products and services in a customer-centric logic, enabling operational and business models that are rapidly aligned to the growing needs of customers and the market. The work of the Quality and CX (Customer Experience) Task Force activated in July 2020 continued in 2022, which is dedicated to analysing and listening to customer opinions in real time, with the aim of triggering rapid and selective action in respect of the evidence emerging from ongoing discussions with customers and the front line. In the course of 2022, the activity involved more than 222 people, highlighted 361 feedbacks and addressed 381 improvement actions.

The impact of digital transformation is relevant in many industries, particularly in the postal sector. Poste Italiane is therefore called upon to recognise these changes and to take action to provide customers with new tools to meet their needs. The Company aims to implement all booking system in the Post Office so that each appointment can be planned exactly, considering that the percentage of customers planning an appointment, currently around 10%, is set to increase in the short term. Crucial in this respect is the added value resulting from the omnichannel experience.

Finally, Poste Italiane also implemented several interventions in the area of waiting time management, with the related attribution of new functions provided to the reception operator (ODA) in order to direct customers to the fastest and most suitable channel for their needs. In fact, the Company has long been focusing on strengthening the advisory service, entrusting each financial advisor with a portfolio of clients. The portfolio of retail customers is one of the pillars of Poste Italiane's strategy to achieve its objectives and is the lever for effective customer management based on the new advisory service model.

# Poste Italiane's omnichannel strategy

The impact of digital transformation is relevant in many sectors and even more so in the postal sector. Poste Italiane is structuring an omnichannel service model that provides value and quality to both the many customers who prefer the digital mode and those who prefer to frequent Post Offices.

Poste Italiane's model is based on a strong integration between physical and remote accessibility to the services provided, and is based on four pillars:

- z new reception model;
- z relational desk;
- z strengthening the tools that enable the Company to bring about this change;
- z valorisation of consulting rooms.

The integrated model is necessary since 94% of Italians live within five minutes of a Post Office or PuntoPoste.

The full integration of its channels enables the Poste Italiane Group to effectively manage customers, from engagement to sales, through a data-driven service model supported by technology-intensive processes and customer operations. This model also contributes to the digitalisation process of the country by reducing the digital divide. Through its omnichannel interaction platform, Poste Italiane handles 20 million daily customer interactions, 6.7 million of which come from digital channels.

In addition, the "Punto Poste Casa & Famiglia", a new space where citizens can find the entire range of products and services dedicated to the home and family, designed to simplify and enhance customer relations, is active in many Post Offices. At the "Punto Poste Casa & Famiglia", it is also possible to find out about the offers of PosteMobile Casa, easily activate PostePay Evolution, subscribe to a Poste Guidare Sicuri RCA policy, or apply for all of Poste Italiane's more "traditional" products, such as the "Libretto di Risparmio Postale" or the "Buono Fruttifero Postale".

PostePay SpA is among the award-winning companies in the first edition of Italy's Best Customer Service 2022-2023. The award aims to identify the brands with the best customer service and the companies that have distinguished themselves for high quality customer service in Italy.

The ranking was carried out by the Corriere della Sera supplement "l'Economia" in cooperation with Statista GmbH, an international research and analysis company, and involved the opinion of around 15,000 consumers. The category for which PostePay took first place is that of Fixed Telephony and Internet Companies, with the PosteMobile brand. The consumer survey considered several parameters, including professional competence, communication, service availability, customer orientation, and service variety.

PostePay's commitment has always been to put the customer first by offering quality services, with the aim of satisfying the customer at every stage: from purchase, to use, to customisation, to requesting assistance.

PostePay's customer service is based on customer culture and is transversal to the Company, involving all staff in all phases of the design, development and delivery of offers and management processes. PostePay has constantly evolved its services, capabilities and customer care in this direction, offering customers increasingly advanced tools to manage their offers and services, from a multi-service and multi-channel perspective.

Every year, Smau, Italy's leading trade fair dedicated to information and communication technologies, presents the Innovation Award to companies that have contributed to the growth of the country system with innovative and concrete proposals. This year's award-winners also include Poste Italiane, which has introduced a customer care service intermediated by artificial intelligence via voice (voicebot) and chat (chatbot and appbot), with the aim of promoting a radical cultural, organisational and technological change in the assistance model.

In the new model, the human operator was thus gradually supported at first by a chatbot, a system that operates in natural language, dialogues and provides answers and solutions to customers via chat on the site/app and WhatsApp, which was later joined by a telephone answering channel on the helpline numbers via voicebot, which provides voice answers in automatic mode on the various channels for the different areas of Poste Italiane's business, from finance to logistics.

The use of artificial intelligence has several positive impacts for both customers and the Company, as it allows for 24-hour customer service 365 days a year, which helps to bring part of the population closer to and familiarise them with advanced technological systems, relieves operators of the most repetitive tasks, and allows them to dedicate themselves to activities that require human intervention.

Failure to meet customer needs is a risk driver that is assessed by the Board of Directors, also with reference to customer experience indicators, such as the complaint rate, which in 2022 decreased by 25% compared to the previous year.

The tool for optimising own operational activities and guaranteeing high quality standards is the monitoring of the quality delivered and perceived by the customer, both on a relational and transactional level. Indicative of the Company's desire to meet the needs of its customers is the use of quality resources in the Mail, Parcels and Distribution function, distributed at local and central level, who carry out targeted measurement, prevention and improvement activities to achieve the Company's objectives.

In order to collect and analyse data from the desired sources of interest, such as social networks, app stores, Post Office reviews on Google Maps, public online information sources, blogs and forums, the Company uses a Web Opinion Monitoring (WOM) service, through which it generates realtime reporting of all topics of interest. The service responds to the needs of different member structures and consolidates in a single solution the services used by the various functions of Poste Italiane and Group companies.

At the organisational level, through the area dedicated to digital channel management, activated in 2020 to enable continuous improvement of experience KPIs gathered both from customer listening and from the analysis of external sources (store app, Google comments, etc.), more than 700 interventions were carried out up to 2022. These interventions positively affected the CES and rating app KPIs measured on the channels. The main releases include: the possibility for customers to purchase the main products online in a simplified manner (Postepay Digital Card, Current Account, "Libretto Minori", Loans), the evolution and innovation of the Home page of the Postepay and BancoPosta apps by grafting engagement elements aimed at driving sales and transactions, the possibility for customers to withdraw without the use of a card at ATM Postamat using the apps, the enabling of direct debits for utilities, the possibility of consulting their receipts for payments made online and at Post Offices directly on the notice board, and the possibility of requesting online and consulting the ISEE declaration on the notice board.

Innovation in Customer Care Service Systems

{359}------------------------------------------------

In addition, the continuous improvement and simplification of key processes from an omnichannel perspective continued in 2022. Among the most important interventions are the evolution of the access model in the Post Office, through an initial simplification of the booking process that will be completed in 2023, the simplification of identification in the Post Office, the completion of the customer profile to enable it to operate in multi-channel mode, and the signing of the digital signature also from the Post Office.

The areas for improvement that have emerged in relation to customer feedback constitute an important stimulus for process assessment and revision activities, together with the support activities functional to maintaining quality certifications and those identified by the "inter-functional communities". In this area, the use of a process mining platform, purchased in 2022 by the Group, continued in 2021, which enables more effective service quality improvement projects with a strongly data-driven approach. During the year, the platform was used on improvement projects related to transversal processes such as "successions" and the "invoicing phase of the asset cycle".

Since 2021, Poste Italiane has held UNI ISO 22222 certification for financial advisers who assist savers in their investment choices. The certification confirms the Group's commitment to supporting the widest application of ethical and sustainability principles to enhance the development of professional skills and offer services dedicated to customers' needs. Poste Italiane was, in fact, the first among large Italian companies to achieve UNI ISO 22222 and UNI TS 11348 certifications for the Investment Advisory Service Model of financial advisors engaged in the role of personal financial planners. In addition, the concomitant certification on purchasing methods places Poste Italiane among the country's leading economic and production entities qualified in sustainable management of purchasing processes and supplier relations.

Poste Italiane brings the system for collecting and managing complaints under the responsibility of the "Customer Care Services" function. The objective of this structure is to address and guide the customer's expectations through a series of customised solutions, adopting a model that makes service a competitive lever both of the customer relationship and of the support of the business. The Group's objective is to build a customer support journey for each business segment, enabling over time more efficient management of the customer experience, with the progressive adoption of innovative technological tools. With the spread of artificial intelligence within Customer Care Services,

Poste Italiane managed to increase the number of managed contracts by 10% in 2022 compared to 2021, with AI accounting for 39% of managed contracts (33% in 2021).

Poste Italiane has always paid the utmost attention to the needs of its customers to ensure their complete satisfaction, in order to offer the product or service best suited to their needs and preferences. In cases where the customer's expectations are not met, the cooperation of the customer becomes essential for the Company to identify and remove the causes of the inconvenience. Co-operation, in fact, on the one hand allows the interested party to have its needs met, and on the other hand to put in place the necessary corrective actions and activities to improve business processes. In this regard, Poste Vita has adopted a Complaints Policy that precisely defines the principles for handling customer grievances aimed at their correct and timely handling. In addition, the preparation of a monthly Complaints Report allows the monitoring of the above activities, highlighting the main causes of complaints and the corrective actions put in place to resolve them.

The issue of quality, which is also strongly integrated within the corporate development strategy, takes on a primary role within the Poste Italiane Group's Integrated Policy, with the aim of mapping, within the framework of quality management systems, all the processes that contribute to the design, development and implementation of a product or service.

Moreover, Poste Italiane considers it of fundamental importance to build customer relationships characterised by the pursuit of maximum transparency and fairness. For this reason, the Company requires its employees to constantly strive to meet its customers' expectations, and envisages that the principles set out in the Integrated Policy should be transposed by the Group Companies, according to their autonomy and independence, adapting them according to their size, organisational and operational context and any regulatory provisions (e.g. Financial and Insurance sectors).

In order to ensure the highest level of effectiveness and efficiency of processes, activities and resources, the Company has adopted an Integrated Management System that allows it to produce reporting that represents the trend of complaints and customer experience indicators. As far as quality is concerned, the Integrated Management System enables the Company to constantly implement initiatives to improve the regulatory system and, without prejudice to the autonomy of the individual business units in the drafting of content and procedures, to pool formats and tools.

{360}------------------------------------------------

In particular, in accordance with the UNI EN ISO 9001:2015 standard, the Group has adopted an effective Quality Management System, thanks to which it carries out its activities in accordance with the following principles:

- z maintain adequate service quality, specifically, by ensuring efficiency and continuity of service in accordance with the specific requirements;
- z maintain the adequacy of the services offered to customers;
- z respect time and optimise the cost/quality ratio of products and services.

The Quality Management System, which guarantees through its functions the satisfaction of customers' expectations, enables Poste Italiane to pursue the continuous improvement of its performance and standard of competitiveness on the market. The System plays an essential role in defining the rules and limits applicable to quality control at all levels. Therefore, any anomalies found are recorded and reported through specific audits and periodic checks.

With regard to the quality of the service and products offered, the foundations of the management model are based on dialogue with customers, which allows for the establishment of a relationship of harmony and to identify their needs in the best possible way. This action is characterised by:

- z sharing with Top Management periodical reports on quality indicators;
- z detection of the level of Customer experience in relation to the various business units, measured twice a year through the detection of the Net Promoter Score (NPS), indicative of the level of customer satisfaction. These are surveys using CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing) and CAWI (Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing) methods that an external research institute carries out on samples of customers representative of the reference universe;
- z measurement of the level of customer experience with regard to the use of the channels, measured by the Customer Effort Score, which detects the ease of access to them. These are CATI measurements for customer service and CAPI (Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing) for Post Offices;
- z monitoring of the degree of customer satisfaction and gathering of opinions and suggestions to identify opportunities for improvement using the Customer Effort Score (CES) indicator, applied to the Group's channels (Post Offices, call centres and the web), which makes it possible to analyse how easily and in how long the Company solves problems;
- z adequate management of complaints, aimed at identifying and remedying, through the necessary corrective actions, the causes that resulted in the inconvenience, with a view to continuous improvement of business processes.

Consistent with what was done in previous years, the Group further refined its customer listening activities through its multiple touch points for postal, financial and insurance services. Once a year, the NPS is also measured for the most representative competitors of the Poste Italiane Group's businesses.

Continuous listening to the front line of business channels was also activated in 2022. Large Customer Accounts and SME/ POE Accounts thus have an always-on survey through which they can point out areas for improvement in sales and aftersales customer management. During the year, the frequency of NPS measurement of large customers was increased and the 'Inner Close The Loop' process was implemented, which consists of the analysis of customer verbatims by an inter-functional team with the aim of structuring a follow-up, which is returned to each individual customer by the Account.

As far as customer interaction is concerned, recall management is crucial for the Poste Italiane Group because it can be an instrumental indicator in defining the Group's level of service. It also contributes to the assessment and management of operational and reputational risks, as well as non-compliance and conduct risks. In this regard, specific reporting systems are used to analyse the progress of complaints, carried out on a weekly and monthly basis, which communicate the results to top management. Each Poste Italiane Group company has adopted and implemented specific procedures outlining the principles and procedures for handling complaints, and these procedures are periodically submitted to their respective Boards of Directors for approval.

During 2022, the Poste Italiane Group implemented its financial services offering. Customers can subscribe to the "Prestito BancoPosta Business Link Online", developed in cooperation with Banca Aidexa SpA, which enables digital loans to be offered to sole proprietorships and small businesses.

In the area of insurance services, the new "Digital Protection" feature of "Poste Vivere Protetti" has been included in the modular offer. Through PostePay's omnichannel platform, the Group has assumed a strategic role in the provision of payment services, reaching a number of "Evolution" cards of almost nine million and more than 23 million users who have adopted PosteID to certify their digital identity.

On 15 June 2022, the Group launched an offer under its own energy brand aimed initially at current employees and pensioners. The transparent and completely green "Energy 160" offer was introduced in honour of Poste Italiane's 160-year history and includes the supply of both gas and electricity for users, for a total of around 30,000 contracts signed.

# Poste Italiane

# Dialogue with consumer associations

Poste Italiane shares with the Consumer Associations a path oriented towards confrontation, dialogue and collaboration, on a small and large scale. The Framework Agreement signed in 2011, and then renewed in 2018, through which the "Cantiere Consumatori" was set up, a permanent working and consultation group made up of a single representative of each Association and Group representatives, whose purpose is to identify the best solutions to reconcile the Company's needs with those of its customers in the context of consumer-oriented corporate initiatives. Through the working group, the Company has been able to increase the quality of its products and services over time by adopting a constructive and transparent approach between the parties.

Furthermore, in order to follow up on the issues that emerged and were addressed at the round table and to promote initiatives, the newsletter "*Dialogando con i Consumatori*" was created, an information tool addressed to the territorial representatives of Consumer Associations. The aim of this project is to inform stakeholders about the main news related to Poste Italiane's activities and to provide them with new insights

# Cybersecurity, IT Security and Privacy

In a global context characterised by an ever-increasing presence of the digital world as a cornerstone for business development and continuity, Poste Italiane attaches particular importance to the adoption and implementation of effective security systems for the defence of the Company's information assets and consequent data breaches. Therefore, the adoption of valid computer security systems is instrumental to the correct functioning and provision of own services and guarantees the confidentiality of data and information, preventing any type of access to unauthorised parties.

Among the priorities of the Poste Italiane Group is the protection and safeguarding of the information assets of customers and stakeholders. This is made possible by technologically advanced systems and state-of-the-art defence measures

This includes the Corporate Affairs - Information Security structure, which carries out a monthly cyber risk assessment for the Group. The methodology currently in use considers this risk from a purely technological point of view based on preventive technical security audits carried out on the three applications: Vulnerability Assessment, Static and Dynamic Code Review, Penetration Test.

- z Vulnerability Assessment, is the process of identifying, measuring and prioritising the vulnerabilities of a system. The assessment is performed with special tools twice a year for each application;
- z Code Review (Static and Dynamic), represents the pro-

and recommendations, in order to further tighten the bond of knowledge and cooperation that has always characterised the relationship between the Company and consumers.

In order to guide consumers through the online purchasing process, Poste Italiane has made available to them the "E@ sy commerce" manual, created in collaboration with nineteen Consumer Associations and Netcomm, the Italian E-commerce Consortium whose members include the most important national operators in the e-commerce sector.

In order to ensure the availability of all the information necessary for the efficient use of postal products and to describe the quality objectives that the Company is committed to achieving for each of them, Poste Italiane makes available the Postal Services Charters, which provide all the information on the main products, delivery targets and times for Italy and abroad, complaints and refunds. The Universal Postal Service Charter includes products covered by the Universal Postal Service (Legislative Decree 261/99). The Postal Services Charter includes products not covered by the Universal Postal Service.

cess of checking the source code of an application to verify that the correct security controls are in place and that they are working as intended. By means of special tools, the verification is carried out of both the source code ("Static CR") and of the code in execution ("Dynamic CR");

- z Penetration Test, the process of evaluating the security of a system or a network through the simulation of attacks that aim to gain undue access to the system. Being a time-consuming activity, it is performed on a specific perimeter of applications.
With the aim of ensuring effective and efficient management of potential cyber risks in the Company, Poste Italiane combines these precautionary measures with two other indispensable parameters: patching and hardening. Together, these activities are aimed at resolving vulnerabilities by keeping the operating system, firmware and applications up-to-date, activating only required ports and services, and obfuscating easily breached system components.

The cyber risk assessment revolves around two main dimensions, Severity and Confidence. Severity identifies the severity level of cyber vulnerabilities; on the contrary, confidence refers the level of reliability of the cyber risk value, which depends on the coverage degree of the checks carried out in terms of number of completed analyses. Downstream of the entire analysis process, Recovery Plans are drawn up, i.e. the main corrective measures necessary to fill the safety gaps identified during the various analyses, including the technical ones. In the past, the management 

{362}------------------------------------------------

of Recovery Plans relating to the various security activities has involved the contribution of a number of Poste Italiane Group functions.

During 2022, the implementation of the new BCM (Business Continuity Management) model in the financial perimeter was started with the definition of the relevant Business Continuity Plan, Business Continuity Risk Analysis and Assessment Methodology. Organisational and technological solutions for continuity were tested and training events on business continuity were held. The following are the main initiatives of the year:

- z Two cyber incident management drills in the financial sector;
- z Involvement and coaching of the main corporate structures that have to adapt to the new model (Security Officers, Business Owners);
- z Acquisition of specific licences to automate processes;
- z Definition of the test plan for organisational solutions;
- z Definition of test plan for technological solutions;
- z Incident management and business continuity drills;
- z Training event focusing on the supply chain and the role of Business and Process Owners.

In addition, Poste Italiane has undertaken a number of further initiatives:

- z developed a Security Planning, defining and implementing a methodology for planning technical security audits (Penetration Tests, Static and Dynamic Code Review) deriving from regulatory/contractual requirements and from the Security By Design process;
- z extended the scope of Cyber Risk analysis to include BancoPosta, PostePay, Poste Vita, Poste Assicura, Poste Welfare Servizi and other compliance/security areas;
- z set up the Information Security Committee DTO, a periodic working table between the Information Security and Digital, Technology & Operations functions with the aim of jointly planning and directing security activities and identifying areas for improvement;
- z a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has been entrusted with the responsibility of the Group's cyber security to ensure better management of the issue.

In order to ensure business continuity for the management of crisis situations resulting from sectoral, corporate or extensive

incidents affecting the Group, Poste Italiane has defined and implemented a business continuity plan based on an appropriate identification of the most critical systems, the potential threats that may occur on them and the countermeasures to be taken. This plan must, therefore, describe the criteria, procedures, technical and organisational measures and tools adopted for emergency management (Contingency Plan) and for the restoration of operating conditions prior to the occurrence of a harmful event (Disaster Recovery) in accordance with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) agreed with the internal customer. To ensure its effectiveness over time, the business continuity plan is tested and updated periodically (at least every six months) and in the face of significant organizational, technological and infrastructural innovations or more generally, in all those situations that can generate new risks.

In relation to the crisis that emerged due to the conflict in Ukraine, levels of monitoring and attention to security events were raised and cyber intelligence activities were strengthened in order to prevent or promptly intercept potential cyberattacks against the Poste Italiane Group. In addition, specific measures were put in place to minimise the attack surface and its impact on Poste Italiane's customer base.

Timely and effective business continuity and crisis management is ensured by the application of a Business Continuity Plan and a Crisis Management Plan, which are an integral part of a framework that also includes a Disaster Recovery Plan, a Communication Plan, a Test Plan, and operational procedures and instructions. In particular, in 2022, Poste Italiane recorded a 57% reduction in cybersecurity breaches or incidents compared to 2021.

In order to minimise human factor risks and their impacts, several training initiatives for internal staff were launched in 2022. Technical drills were carried out for security guards with the aim of strengthening their capabilities to detect, analyse and coun-

-57% IT security breaches/cybersecurity incidents compared to 2021

ter cyber threats or attacks, and Table Top Scenario cyber incident management and business continuity drills aimed at testing business processes and procedures, as well as the correct interpretation and effectiveness of procedures in reallife cases.

Through its "Poste Sicuri Online" anti-fraud campaign, Poste Italiane presented guidelines in 2022 to prevent fraud against its customers. The campaign aims to spread simple rules and tricks to avoid computer security issues. These rules protect all postal operations carried out by the user, whether traditional or digital.

In this sense, a supporting tool are the Poste Italiane apps, which can also be used to take advantage of the free push notification service in order to stay informed in real time about payment transactions made with a current account and payment cards. Alternatively, it is possible to activate the SMS notification service on a mobile phone, which is free of charge for payments on websites and apps.

# Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)

Given the complexity that characterises Poste Italiane's underlying organisation, the Group's cyber strategy has increasingly matured over the years, through the adoption of different organisational and technological solutions to minimise exposure to potential attacks. In this context, Poste Italiane set up the Computer Emergency Response Team in 2013, in order to ensure Group-wide oversight of cybersecurity and data protection activities, and to actively fight cybercrime. The working group performs a governance function in Crisis Management and Group Business Continuity to ensure the continuity of services. The team is made up of IT security experts who carry out their duties by operating in real time 24 hours a day to prevent risks, manage IT incidents affecting company systems and develop actions in response to cyber events, reinforcing in this way the defence capability of the entire company. This organisation is part of a wider network of similar structures, both nationally and internationally, with which it interacts constantly by sharing information, indicators of compromise and attack models in general. In this regard, Poste Italiane collaborates with CNAIPIC (National Centre Against Cybercrime for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure) division of the Postal Police.

CERT has structured its services in such a way as to ensure the overall protection of Poste Italiane's business, acting on a number of levels:

- z External perimeter, which prevents attacks by collecting and exchanging information on threats and vulnerabilities that may affect the Group's services;
- z Internal perimeter, which protects the corporate infrastructure and responds to potential IT emergencies.

Over the last few years, CERT has evolved towards a new generation model oriented towards the management of big data and the use of modern data analysis and business intelligence tools, the increasing use of algorithms and techniques of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and data mining. This model allows the centralisation of all information pertaining to Poste Italiane's security domain. In addition, CERT develops training and awareness initiatives aimed at promoting a cybersecurity culture among the Group's technical and non-technical staff, customers and citizens.

#### IT security

Results and next steps

Involving, informing and conveying awareness on cybersecurity issues to all the Company's personnel is the objective of Poste Italiane's CERT, a centre of excellence that deals every day with the protection of company data, through prevention, analysis and protection against cyber threats.

In 2022, a campaign was conducted to raise awareness of the spread of malicious e-mails. The introduction of the "Report Phishing" button on the Microsoft platform was an important tool in the prevention and fight against cybercrime. CERT also promoted a campaign on the 'cash for SMS' phenomenon, linked to smartphone apps that offer to buy unused SMS messages for promotional campaigns and advertising messages to other phone numbers, exposing the user to a number of risks.

In order to disseminate the culture of cybersecurity among the Group's employees, a 12-episode miniseries was produced, based on real-life cases, in which the protagonist is a cyber investigator dealing with cyber crimes. The series is loosely based on the novel "Il giorno del Bianconiglio" (The Day of the White Rabbit) by Alessandro Curioni and aims to show how the world of the Net can overwhelm the real world.

{364}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane constantly dedicates attention and security to its employees and customers. As proof of this, Poste Italiane recorded a 90% reduction of customers involved in IT security breaches compared to 2021. The figure confirms the effectiveness of the activities carried out by the Business Control Centre Group, the security pact with the Postal Police and further agreements with different institutions and finally, the prevention actions carried out on a daily basis.

-90%

customers involved in IT security breaches compared to 2021

The Business Control Center (BCC) is the area of the Head Office in which Poste Italiane's business processes are monitored according to an integrated service delivery model and is presented as the Company's technological hub. The tasks for which this function is responsible include:

- z real-time control, 24 hours a day, of the services provided by the Group;
- z the protection of the safety of customers inside Post Offices and of personnel in all workplaces;
- z combating fraud and cybercrime;
- z experimentation of the services offered by the Company.

The BCC consists of seven control rooms that use state-ofthe-art applications and instrumentation to ensure the proper functioning of the postal-logistics network and guarantee the delivery of services and correct communication to Poste Italiane's customers.

Poste Italiane also maintains its strong collaborative relationship with the Postal and Communications Police. This agreement envisaged activities aimed at preventing and combating offences relating to the products and production processes of the services offered by the Poste Italiane Group; surveillance at Post Offices during scheduled payment periods; the establishment of task forces to analyse new methods of computer fraud; and the development of new cybersecurity tools. These measures were necessary to cope with changing scenarios and new types of malicious events. This has prompted the Company to quickly readjust its operations over the years, especially with reference to payment systems for e-commerce and financial and insurance services, for which it was necessary to intensify the activity of control and updating of the physical and IT security structures.

# Personal data protection

Over the years, the Company has attached great importance to the issue of personal data protection, constantly upgrading its corporate regulatory system and ensuring full compliance with current provisions and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), taking charge of the control of the management review process at Group level, as set out in art. 32. This regulatory system, consisting of procedures, guidelines and policies, is also applied in relations with all partners and suppliers, in order to ensure proper management of the risks related to privacy in all the Group's operations. Failure to comply with the standards defined by the system that leads to the occurrence of violations, may result in the application to employees of the disciplinary sanctions provided by the CCNL of Poste Italiane, gradually stricter based on the severity of the violation (written warning, fine, suspension of service with loss of pay, dismissal without notice, etc.). In this regard, Poste Italiane has drawn up a Corporate Policy on Personal Data Protection and Privacy Guidelines and a Personal Data Protection Management System, the latter introduced with the aim of ensuring uniform data management at Group level. In particular, the Guidelines define the Company privacy model and implements the principles of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default, which establish the need for the Company to ensure adequate protection of personal data from the design of products/services and IT systems and to guarantee compliance with privacy legislation by default in processes for the collection and processing of data. Poste Italiane is also committed to ensuring proper management of data protection risks, including by carrying out the periodic management review process at the Group level.

By adopting policies and information campaigns aimed at raising data protection awareness, the Group promotes the protection of the personal data of all stakeholders

Poste Italiane's Privacy Framework was created with the aim of ensuring compliance with these obligations and aspiring to the continuous improvement of the management system. This framework provides an overview of the areas of intervention in which the relevant organisational and technical frameworks that have been developed operate, in order to provide continuous monitoring of the progress achieved.

{365}------------------------------------------------

Poste Italiane identifies for the entire Group the figure of the Data Protection Officer, a privacy expert who assumes responsibility for supervising compliance with the regulations on the protection of personal data by the data controller, as provided for by the GDPR, and who also ensures the drive towards continuous improvement.

Consistent with this approach, the Privacy function ensures nomophylactic oversight at the Group level for all responsibilities relating to personal data protection issues and coordinates the development of the aforementioned framework.

The Privacy Service Center operates within this function and its task is to represent a single point of reference for customers in matters of privacy and to collect and manage efficiently and centrally all the requests received from customers, such as requests for access, rectification or integration of personal data and changes in the consent given, also monitoring their progress in order to identify any opportunities to improve business processes.

The Privacy Service Center, due to its approach towards continuous improvement, unique handling of customer requests and correct compliance with regulatory provisions, is certified for its information security management system according to ISO 27001:2013 and for personal data protection according to ISO 27701:2019.

{366}------------------------------------------------

In 2022, Poste Italiane achieved ISO 27701:2019 certification for its data protection management system.

ISO 27701:2019 specifies requirements and provides guidance for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and continuous improvement of a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) in the form of an extension of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy management in the context of the organisation. The document specifies the requirements for PIMS and provides guidance for those responsible for the processing of personally identifiable information (PII) and for those in charge of processing it.

By achieving this security standard, Poste Italiane's Privacy function is able to demonstrate compliance of certified services with GDPR and other data privacy requirements.

Poste Italiane obtains the ISO 27701 certification

# Innovation and digitalisation of products, services and processes

Today, companies, in response to changes in the global competitive landscape linked to an ever-increasing quest for sustainable success, have had to rework their products, services and processes. For Poste Italiane, innovation and digitalisation are two central drivers of strategic progress and enable it to guarantee its customers innovative technological solutions, also through the integration of its own products and services with those of third parties. Through these drivers, the Company not only guarantees the accessibility and efficiency of its offer to all citizens, but also promotes the connection with the Public Administration and the Italian entrepreneurial world, setting itself as a reference point on the path towards innovation and digitalisation of the country. In February 2023, Poste Italiane plans to expand its range of services by entering the energy sector with a 100% green product. The Poste Energia offer provides custom-

ers with electricity produced exclusively in Italy from renewable sources and certified through guarantees of origin. This project allows the Group to correlate green transition issues with those of innovation and digitalisation, while representing a major opportunity for sustainable development at national level.

For the Poste Italiane Group, innovation and digitalisation are the main drivers of strategic progress, fundamental to ensuring cutting-edge technological solutions

By adopting an innovative approach, the Company has managed to supplement its traditional offer with new proposals and to adapt quickly and effectively to a changing socio-economic context. In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country was forced to accelerate the digitalisation and innovation path started in previous years and Poste Italiane, thanks to customer-oriented technological solutions implemented directly through digital channels, supported companies in the transition.

# Innovation and digitalisation of products and services

During 2022, Poste Italiane achieved important results in terms of development and value creation for the country and the community, and thanks to its constant commitment to the search for cutting-edge digital solutions and the integration of new business models, it was able to revisit its range of products and services.

# Payments and current accounts

In order to mitigate potential negative impacts, measures were implemented in the area of payments to streamline existing processes aimed at improving the customer experience by increasing the use of PostePay's products/services increasingly focused on omnichannel. These actions also concerned communications, so as to make the information easily accessible to the customer. In particular, in the area of issuing, the Company confirmed its commitment to implementing communication activities in order to make the status of its charter and its operations clearer and more transparent. In addition, the content of the website and the documentation related to the services and products available for the Customer Service function are periodically updated using the feedback gathered through listening to the customer. Consistent with the PostePay Operating Rules (ROF) and in compliance with the Product Oversight Governance (POG) process, periodic monitoring is carried out for the products issued, with particular regard to:

- z information flows between distributor and manufacturer concerning the coherence between the target market identified for the product and how it was placed with customers;
- z evaluation of the results and critical issues that emerged during the marketing phase.

Specifically, in order to address the actual negative impacts, an internal PostePay cross-functional table was opened to identify and map the critical points and take timely action on them.

In 2022, in continuity with previous years, the Company implemented the digital payment services available, through an ecosystem of collection services available to consumer, business and PA customers, which can be used either through the physical network or through web or app channels. Still considering digital payments, the Group extended the "SoftPOS" service not only to the express courier SDA - the first entity to be enabled for the service - but also to post officers. Thanks to the new PDA, Poste Italiane's operators are able to handle cash-on-delivery mail and parcels and, through Tap on Phone ("SoftPOS") technology, authorise contactless payments through PostePay's "Pay with code" functionality. Furthermore, in 2022, "SoftPOS" saw the enabling of a "posless" electronic payment acceptance service on proprietary devices of large merchants.

{371}------------------------------------------------

In order to ensure the evolution of the loyalty programme by introducing more flexibility and opportunities for the development and enhancement of the customer base, Poste Italiane, in addition to 'SoftPOS', introduced a new online payment method, the QR Code Web, which can be framed from the Postepay app by the cardholder, allowing customers a frictionless, secure and unique experience. Payment with QR code is in addition to the payment methods already available in Pay with Postepay.

In addition, during 2022, the Group introduced a new "MPOS Postepay" offer by restyling the device and its packaging, with a view to environmental sustainability, using sustainable materials and improving sales and activation processes. In line with the commercial launch of the new "MPOS Postepay" product, an integrated Service Model was implemented with the new technology provider, which aims to ensure a smooth and transparent customer experience in the service process. At the same time, this model allows the Group to have an all-round understanding of the product's user experience, as well as to monitor the supplier's performance thanks to the real-time alignment of Poste Italiane's support systems in relation to tickets opened by the supplier. Finally, the delivery process of the "MPOS Postepay" product was improved, ensuring the fast availability of the collection service for the customer.

In the area of e-money, the Group promoted the continuity of its innovative products and services, launching, for example, the release of digital functionalities on the business channel of Postepay Evolution Business, together with the consolidation of important partnerships in the field of acquiring.

Additionally, thanks to the Open Banking platform, customers can manage accounts and cards, even if they are held at other banks or payment service providers, directly on the BancoPosta and Postepay apps. These initiatives make Poste Italiane's infrastructure open and offer customers increasingly connected and comprehensive services.

Opening a BancoPosta account can be done directly from a mobile device thanks to the instructions provided by the app, and it is possible to choose the desired type from several options: "Start Giovani", "Start" e "Medium". The account is opened and activated after a few days. With regard to the "Premium" service, aimed at customers with high capitalisation and sophisticated needs, remote consultancy is guaranteed, at the end of which customers will be able to sign the necessary documents with an advanced electronic signature in the dedicated area on the Poste Italiane website. Premium consultants are carefully selected following continuous and highly specialised training.

As far as current accounts dedicated to Business and Public Administration are concerned, in 2022, "BancoPosta Business Link", a current account for Small Business customers, introduced in the previous year and provided with a modular offer accessible online, was awarded at the MF Banking Awards with the Innovation Award in the category "Accounts and payments for business customers".

The offer launched in 2021, whereby the fee for the first year of the Postepay Evolution Business card is reimbursed with the request for the "Tandem Mobile POS" or "Tandem Physical POS" acquiring service and, at the same time, with the request for the card itself, was activated for the duration of 2022.

#### BancoPosta

Towards an increasingly customer-centric approach

In line with the Group's Strategic Plan, BancoPosta's contribution proved to be extremely relevant in 2022, confirming its position as the most reliable financial institution in Italy thanks to its omnichannel approach that guarantees a wide range of insurance and investment products.

The three pillars that guarantee the offer of an innovative business model are: people, the investment target for growth and the development of technical and professional skills; the platform, which increasingly guarantees adequate support for commercial activity and appropriate interaction with customers; and the products, which include, for example, multi-class policies, numerous partnerships and joint ventures.

By adopting an omnichannel logic, which allows for integration and synergy between channels for accessing products and services, BancoPosta is constantly adapting its activities to an increasingly customer-centric perspective.

{372}------------------------------------------------

In 2022, the collaboration between Poste Italiane and Santander Consumer Bank continued for the development and release of the Prestito Personale BancoPosta product.

During the year, the Group encouraged the use of ATMs and digital channels and apps to perform various transactions, as an alternative to the counter for cash withdrawals. In the current context of digital progress, the Company is committed to guaranteeing its customers an offer that favours the use of electronic money and, at the same time, the fight against cash. The Group's research and commitment, as well as supporting government initiatives, have also enabled the development of a number of products and services:

- z Postepay Digital, the first 100% digital Postepay prepaid card suitable for online payments, public transport payments, payments via QR code or Google Pay for
owners of an Android-enabled smartphone. It is managed by the Postepay app and allows users to request an associated IBAN code to receive or make transfers, credit their salary and pay their utility bills. In 2022, the possibility was introduced for customers to apply for Postepay Digital also through the web. Users who decide to receive the IBAN version of the card have the opportunity to request free of charge the physical card at home, so that they can withdraw cash from any ATM and pay at establishments affiliated with the Mastercard circuit;

- z Postepay PA, the prepaid card completely dedicated to the Public Administration, which since its launch, has made it possible to manage the funds and contributions to be paid out to citizens. The organisation can apply for the cards online through BancoPosta's Corporate Banking platform (BPIOL). The card funds are the property of the cardholder, who can top it up and use it for his or her personal expenses according to the limits defined by the institution during the agreement phase. The card has an IBAN code, which can be viewed from the PostePay and Bancoposta apps and from the postepay.it website, and allows SEPA Credit Transfers and Postagiro to be received;
- z Postepay Green, a biodegradable prepaid card made from environmentally friendly organic materials, reserved for young people aged between 10 and 17. The prepaid card allows children to make

quick and secure payments, and parents to quickly make top-ups through the "pocket money" system and to control transactions (parental control). The services described can be used via both web and app channels;

- z Codice Postepay, the new service that allows merchants to manage payments from the Postepay app via a QR code, identifying itself as a reliable and straightforward collection solution for professionals, artisans and small businesses in
the area. The possibility of making a payment by Codex, also within Post Offices, has been supplemented with a promotion that allows to

receive cashback for each transaction made. The initiative, which lasted until the end of 2022, gave the opportunity to obtain €3 cashback for every transaction made with a PostePay code worth at least €10 at one of the participating points of sale, with a maximum of €10 per day. The service can be purchased online and in Post Offices, where it is possible to generate lists of interested users (leads) who are subsequently contracted through sales representatives or contact centers. As of July 2022, the user experience of the Code payment mode was evolved with the launch of "QR Code Web", the solution that allows the cardholder to frame the automatically generated QR code on the payment page, without additional clicks;

- z The Postepay Evolution card is a rechargeable card with IBAN code that guarantees the use of main banking transactions without being tied to a current account. The card, which is accep-
ted by physical and online points of sale operating on the Mastercard circuit, allows money transfers via bank transfers/postagiro, utility payments and the crediting of salary or pension. The Group, through a 'business' version (Postepay Evolution Business) dedicated to self-employed professionals with a VAT number and sole proprietorships, offers the possibility of sending money on wallets and accounts, 24 hours a day, via Postepay app and website to over 200 countries thanks to the partnership with Western Union. In 2022, the digital functionality was also introduced on the Business channel of Postepay Evolution and the conversion of Postepay Evolution to environmentally-friendly materials was planned;

- z The IoStudio Postepay card is the Student Card created by the Ministry of Education, University and Research and distributed to high school students. The card declares student status in Italy
and abroad and in addition to guaranteeing benefits and advantages in establishments affiliated with the MIUR, it allows membership of ScontiPoste. The card has the same functionality as the Postepay card and features high security standards, preventing payments to merchants in product categories prohibited to minors such as gambling, adult services and liquor sales.

Always with a focus on the business world, in the area of acquiring, the long-standing partnership between Poste Italiane and Lottomatica Italia Servizi (LIS) resulted in the acquisition of LIS from International Game Technology PCL (IGT).

{373}------------------------------------------------

### Poste Italiane finalises acquisition of LIS

The Group strengthens its position as a leading paytech company

Poste Italiane, through its subsidiary PostePay SpA, on 14 September 2022, completed the acquisition of LIS Holding SpA (LIS) from International Game Technology PCL (IGT), after obtaining the necessary regulatory and competition authority approvals. This acquisition constitutes the largest M&A transaction in Poste Italiane's history and strengthens PostePay's position as a leading paytech company, contributing to the further enrichment of the Group's omnichannel strategy.

LIS has a proprietary paytech platform, distinctive expertise, a highly qualified management team and is active in the Italian proximity payments market with a network of around 54,000 affiliated points of sale. Its offer consists of various services, including bill payments, prepaid payment cards, phone top-ups and vouchers, as well as solutions for merchants and businesses. LIS also provides integrated management of all back-office activities at the point of sale and of payment and commercial services provided to customers.

In line with Poste Italiane's omnichannel strategy, PostePay further consolidates its leadership in the digital payments and services market, leveraging on LIS's technological know-how to expand its product offering and strengthen its solutions dedicated to Small and Medium Enterprises.

The year 2022 saw the continuation of the partnership with ENI with the gradual activation of Postepay acquiring services (physical POS and in digital mode through the Paga con Postepay solution within the ENI Station app) at participating service stations. The collaboration with ENI has enabled the activation of PagoPA payment slips in over 2,800 service stations, thanks to which it is possible to pay taxes, stamp duties and other payments to the public administration. This opportunity was also extended on the LIS PAY network.

In the transport area, the service that allows payment cards to be accepted through PostePay acquiring at Trenitalia's physical POSs continued, while, as part of the virtual POS Corporate e-commerce acquiring service, the MO.TO services. (Mail Order/Telephone Order) were included, capable of accepting card payments through the telephone channel, payments with saving of card data COF (Card on File) and recurring payments (Recurring).

In 2022, the cooperation between PostePay and Bancomat continued. Under the "acquiring" licence, payments on the Bancomat and PagoBancomat circuits will be accepted in Post Offices, Postamat ATMs and at PostePay-affiliated establishments, and under the "issuing" licence, Postepay cards will be issued on the same circuits.

PostePay is the largest player in the industry with 29 million cards and more than two billion transactions by 2022: more than one and a half million Italians have chosen Postepay cards to make their first e-commerce payments. The agreement enables the interoperability of digital payment platforms thanks to the user-friendliness of the QR code, which has already been successfully exploited for cashback. Successful initiatives that have been introduced in previous years and continued in 2022 include:

- z Apple Pay, enables contactless payments with Postepay debit or prepaid cards from enabled iOS devices;
- z Cardless withdrawal, Postepay card holders can withdraw at Postamat ATMs without having to insert their card, thanks to the cardless mode that involves scanning the QR code shown on the ATM screen;
- z Postepay Open, allows users to top up their Postepay prepaid card with accounts of third-party banks (Payment Initiation Service - PIS) and to be able to view the balance and movement list of the selected current account directly in the Postepay app (Account Information Service - AIS;
- z Postepay Business, dedicated to retail customers, allows them to take advantage of the services of the Postepay ecosystem as well as those typical of a traditional debit card. Card operations can be customised via the PosteBusiness app, on the dedicated web portal and at ATM Postamat. Additionally, the card allows authorisation of e-commerce purchases directly from the app.

### Tap & Go® Public transport becomes contactless

The Tap & Go® agreement between PostePay SpA, Mastercard and the public transport management companies of Milan, Rome, Turin, Bari and Naples allows access to and travel on enabled public transport such as metro, train and bus without having to purchase a paper ticket in advance.

In particular, the agreement allows the use of a prepaid or debit PostePay card belonging to the Mastercard circuit to pay for tickets directly at enabled contactless turnstiles. Payment can be finalised through the use of Apple Pay for iPhones or Google Pay for Android smartphones.

The service has no additional costs over and above those charged by the public transport company.

#### Collections

With regard to the collections sector, Poste Italiane's role is stable in the PagoPA system, also thanks to the extension of the offer of services dedicated to the Central and Local Public Administration (PAC) in digital channels (web and apps).

Since 2020, in addition to BancoPosta, PostePay SpA has also been accredited as a payment service provider on the PagoPA system and it is therefore possible to carry out these operations on all digital channels, in Post Offices and through the portals of creditor institutions, also for payment notices drawn on bank current accounts.

In compliance with the Ministerial Decree of the MEF of 30 April 2021, Poste Italiane has developed the solution "Piattaforma Incassi per le Amministrazioni dello Stato" (Collection Platform for State Administrations), which allows the management of payments related to State Public Administration files through the use of the Bollettino postale (postal payment slip) as a collection tool on the postal current accounts of the treasury.

Poste Italiane's Digital Money Box (Salvadanaio Digitale) is a free digital service that allows customers to set aside specific sums and reach micro-spending and/or saving goals, through the management of their Smart passbook, BancoPosta account and/or Postepay Evolution prepaid card. The service provides the possibility of creating up to 5 savings targets at the same time for a maximum total amount of €5,000. The customer chooses the sum to be accumulated, the date of attainment (from 1 to 24 months) and the relevant category (e.g. travel, leisure) with the option of customisation. Through the sharing functionality, it is also possible to ask family and friends for a contribution to the achievement of the objective. Through the Digital Money Box, the Poste Italiane Group encourages and promotes savings education, customer loyalty and the attraction of new customers, also encouraging the younger target group.

Since 2021, Poste Italiane customers have the option of using the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (or SCT Instant) service on digital channels. Holders of Postepay cards with IBANs and holders of BancoPosta current accounts can have payments credited to the beneficiary in less than 10 seconds, as well as being able to independently manage their payments on the web and app channels. Customers can consult their payments and individual debit history, activate and revoke new mandates, enter specific amount limits and change debit IBAN coordinates also in omnichannel mode. Consistent with the European Central Bank's Roadmap, the process of adhering to the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system was completed, enabling BancoPosta account holders and Postepay holders with IBAN, as well as holders of 'Smart' savings books, to receive instant credit transfers also from PSPs participating in the TIPS circuit.

The implementation of these initiatives aims at improving the user experience by enabling new use cases and facilitating the replacement of traditional payment instruments such as cheques and money orders.

The "Supersmart" offer, dedicated to customers bringing in new liquidity, allows them to access higher than standard interest rates on the amounts set aside at maturity. The "Supersmart 180 Days" offer can be activated at post offices, on poste.it and the BancoPosta app.

Also in 2022, the Group provided the service in the third-party motor liability market, with the Poste Guidare Sicuri product, which saw the Company adopt a gradual sales enabling approach for the distribution network. The service provides extensive coverage and includes a number of free warranty extensions. The car policy is designed to put the safety of the family at the centre, and with the "Guida Libera" formula it allows maximum flexibility in the use of the insured vehicle by the members of the household. To subscribe to the policy, customers can go to one of the 5,000 authorised Post

BancoPosta has deployed one of the most innovative and engaging means to reach new customers and modernise the current account vision. As a result of a co-innovation project of Poste Italiane (thanks to the internal teams in DTO Open Innovation and in BancoPosta), together with the start-up Gamindo, an initiative to invent and realise video games was carried out. An advergame, a branded video game, was developed to promote Poste Italiane and the Conto BancoPosta - Start Giovani option. This race game allowed users to be immersed in a new user experience, involving and informing young people about the services and benefits of the current account dedicated to them, with a strong message of innovation and digitalisation. Through "Conto BancoPosta Start Giovani - The Game", young people can have fun and at the same time discover new information on the services offered, including the possibility of subscribing to the account in the BancoPosta app.

Around 25,000 matches were played by Poste Italiane customers who went online to learn about the BancoPosta Start Giovani account. By playing an average of more than 2 minutes per game (on the various social platforms TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.), around 1,400 accounts were opened at the end of the trial, including through commercial e-mails and links to product site pages.

The game, developed for the BancoPosta Start Giovani account, consists of driving a small blue car on a "suspended" road, preventing it from ending up off the track. Along the way, bonus icons depicting Poste Italiane products are collected. What is of particular interest is the way in which customers are informed about the various services: every time they start to play, or start again after a mistake, users have to answer a simple question dealing with the BancoPosta world. Through the game, much more information is obtained, which in an immediate and user-friendly manner makes customers more familiar with the proposals and advantages of the BancoPosta account.

### Poste Italiane and gamification

Also in the area of insurance, Poste Italiane launched the marketing of an integrated Life and Non-Life offer whereby subscribers to specific Life policies receive a joint offer for a Non-Life policy. The Group's objective is to contain the country's underinsurance phenomenon through customer-oriented awareness-raising actions, as outlined in the Strategic Plan.

Finally, in the area of payments, in 2022, the company recorded a significant growth in the number of digital payments, demonstrated by the spread of cards and, in terms of volume, the increase in card transactions, both in large and small shops. With respect to the phenomenon of the spread of POS, favoured by legal measures and the changing habits of Italians, the Group has made the following services available through the Single Front End also to Small Economic Operators:

- z Postepay Physical POS Service, allows affiliated merchants to accept payments with cards or smartphones (via NFC technology), also in contactless mode, allowing monitoring of card collections, as payments, transactions and online statements can be consulted at any time via Merchant Portal;
- z Postepay's Mobile POS service, allows to accept payments via cards or smartphones, even on the move. This is a zero-fee solution with zero recurring monthly fixed costs, which only includes the one-off cost of purchasing the "Card Reader". The application of transaction fees is among the most competitive on the market. Additionally, the service offers the possibility of handling transactions via a Mobile POS terminal and the appropriate app installed on the smartphone and/or tablet. To accept payments, simply connect the terminal via Bluetooth to the smartphone on which the app is installed, and free monitoring of receipts via the Merchant Portal is guaranteed.

#### Poste Italiane among the 50 companies that are changing the world

The Company was included in Change the World 2022

Poste Italiane's sustainability plans take up one third of the investments in its Business Plan. Thanks to its commitment, the Company was included in Change the World 2022, a list of companies that through their business contribute to changing the world. Change the World does not focus on companies' turnovers, but on their social impact and sustainability.

In particular, Poste Italiane has been rewarded for its commitment to the electrification of deliveries: in fact, the complete renewal of the fleet is underway, with the aim of arriving at about 28,000 environmentally-friendly vehicles by 2024. Among the points emphasised in the analysis of the Group's initiatives is the digitalisation of its information system, with the gradual abandonment of paper, as well as the various initiatives for Italians; in fact, 80% of the more than 30 million Italians registered so far with the SPID digital identity have done so with Poste Italiane. In addition, the Company made its physical and technological network available for the vaccination campaign and accredited itself as a key player in the digitalisation process in Italy. Change the World is not the only award collected by the Group, which has not only been certified by the top rating agencies in almost all areas of sustainable comparison, but has also entered Morgan Stanley's STOXX Global Esg leaders by achieving AA ranking.

# Mobile

In line with the communication services strategy of previous years, which aims to bring advanced internet connectivity solutions to individuals and companies, Poste Italiane, through PostePay SpA, has maintained its agreements with two national operators, Open Fiber and TIM. Open Fiber is a provider of direct internet access and connectivity services to customers through the use of fibre (FTTH) and fibre blended copper (FTTC and FTTE) access technologies. The second agreement, on the other hand, refers to Internet access and connectivity services, but only with FTTH technologies. The partnership with Open Fiber will ensure broad coverage in cities and small towns, while the agreement with TIM envisages the deployment of the FTTH network in more than 1,600 municipalities nationwide by 2025. The dual initiative expands the portfolio of offers aimed at the consumer and business market with new ultrabroadband fibre-optic services, and aims to reduce the digital divide in Italy.

During 2022, Poste Italiane also established itself as a major operator in the telecommunications sector, not only thanks to its partnerships with Open Fiber and TIM, but also by implementing further initiatives:

- z Postepay Connect Back, a service offering an exclusive cashback function. Subscribers of the offer receive a monthly cashback discount that is credited directly to Postepay Evolution, equal to the unused Giga of the tariff plan. Cashback can be used without time constraints and for any type of expenditure;
- z PosteMobile Casa WEB offers 4G wireless internet connection for the home. The service can be purchased online as installation does not require the presence of a technician, and offers unlimited high-performance traffic (speed up to 300 Mbps), with a Wi-Fi modem included on free loan;

{376}------------------------------------------------

- z PosteCasa Ultraveloce, the data-only offer with which Poste Italiane entered the broadband market that allows users to surf from home at fibre speed (1 Gbps) without limits. The service, which can be subscribed to online in a full-digital process, includes a second unlimited connection on a 4G network to offer customers a fast provisioning and full connectivity experience. In addition to the provision of a Wi-Fi modem and a USB stick on loan for free, subscribers to the offer can also activate the 'voice' component for unlimited calls from home to all national fixed and mobile numbers. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw the launch of the PosteCasa Ultraveloce Start product, which can be subscribed to at Post Offices and provides only the fibre data connection, leaving the customer the flexibility to choose whether to also request the second connection on the mobile network with a 4G USB stick. PostePay customers with SPID can access a simplified process to apply online for fibre connectivity;
- z Mobile Tariff Offer, offers mass market promotions, which can be activated from the physical or online channel, which include a high amount of giga and are reserved for all customers;
- z Mobile phone services in the Postepay app, with which PosteMobile SIM card holders, after registering on the poste.it website, can monitor traffic details and make top-ups directly from the app. Additionally, customers have the opportunity to check their telephone rate plan, bonuses and active promotions, as well as available options.

In continuity with previous years, the PosteMobile Casa range of services, launched by PostePay in 2019, enabled the Group to increase its target market through flexible and convenient solutions. The expansion of the offer enables the consolidation of the Company as an institutional player of reference for the digitalisation and development of the coun-

try, especially in areas defined as "failed areas opportunities". Services are provided entirely over the mobile radio network, giving customers maximum flexibility in the use of data services, which can be used anywhere with a Wi-Fi modem connected to the electricity network.

Postepay Connect also continued, which saw the integration of the Postepay Evolution card and the PosteMobile SIM in a single app and proved to be a unique and distinctive offer within the Italian market, underlining the centrality of the online channel as complementary to the Post Office.

In line with the Group's ESG strategic objectives and specifically PostePay's green goals, the new SIM ECO was launched in August 2022. It has innovative features in that all the elements that make up the kit, both the SIM Card and the packaging (Envelope and Card Carrier), are made with materials and methods geared towards environmental sustainability. Specifically, the SIM was made of recycled plastic and half the size, while the card carrier and envelope carry Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.

Thanks to a collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Development, which provides a government bonus, during 2022 Poste Italiane delivered free of charge to less well-off pensioners the decoders they need to watch TV programmes after the switchover to the new digital terrestrial television. The Group delivered TV decoders with a total value of no more than €30 directly to people's homes and also provided telephone assistance during installation of the device.

Customers could request the decoder in three different ways: through the toll-free number, through the form on the Nuova TV Digitale website, or by going to one of the almost 13,000 Italian Post Offices. This initiative is an integral part of the strategy of inclusion and support for the digitalisation of the country included in the Group's Business Plan.

# The Landriano strategic maxi-hub

Updates one year after

One year after its inauguration, the activities of the Landriano e-commerce plant have continued, ensuring fast deliveries throughout Italy. Landriano represents Italy's first major hub for e-commerce and express courier services, capable of processing up to 320,000 parcels per day and ensure fast deliveries throughout Italy. The Landriano hub represents for Poste Italiane a further step in the transformation process of its logistics infrastructure, focused on innovation and sustainability. The facility enables the strategic development of the logistics network along the entire value chain to capture the full growth potential of e-commerce. Furthermore, the Landriano hub is a key part of Poste Italiane's sorting line together with the hubs in Bologna, Piacenza and the Centro di Passo Corese hub in Rome. The four centres are connected to the more than 90 branches and 1,700 delivery centres distributed throughout Italy for the operational handling of parcels that will then be delivered by the network of post officers and couriers.

At the Landriano hub, the sorting system, the operation used to sort goods and shipments, consists of four interconnected machines that automatically sort parcels by destination and weight/volume over 694 outlets, allowing the handling of 39,000 items per hour, using the highest technological standards. The state-of-the-art equipment also includes an innovative sorting system based on 'autonomous mobile sorting' technology, through which goods are sorted according to weight/ volume by one of four machines that handle objects by type: small, medium, large and abnormally shaped. Objects with abnormal shapes are sorted by a specific machine operated by 17 robots to be subsequently processed by one of the system's four machines.

The new Landriano plant strictly adheres to the sustainability principles promoted by the Group. The structure has obtained the BREEAM In-Use Excellent certification, one of the most relevant international certifications in the field of sustainability, for the design and construction choices made. State-of-the-art photovoltaic panels covering a total area of 2,500 square metres were installed on the roof of the facility, providing the hub's daytime energy needs and reducing annual CO2 emissions by 210 tonnes. Additionally, construction materials were used that ensure high performance in terms of energy containment.

# Parcels and Distribution

The Company, also in 2022, made use of an area fleet that proved to be a strategic asset to be able to meet the demanding market demand. In fact, thanks to its air connections, Poste Italiane has made it possible to deliver parcels within 24 hours throughout Italy, including the islands. The Company's aircraft fleet consists of six vehicles in total: five Boeing 737- 400 Cargo and one ATR 72-500 Cargo. Domestically, it operates permanently at 8 airports.

In the delivery area, the Group continued its growth strategy in the logistics segment related to e-commerce purchases by strengthening the potential of its partnership with Amazon. PuntoPoste, Poste Italiane's network for the collection of online purchases and the delivery of any returns, is part of this strategy. It complements the 12,800 Post Offices and consists of around 15,000 alternative collection points including tobacconists, bars, stationers, newsagents, shops and KiPoints, as well as 320 lockers and 80 enabled Carrefour supermarkets. The choice by customers to pick up or send a parcel at one of these points is what is now called "green behaviour", a more responsible and sustainable behaviour as the logistical process behind the use of the service helps to reduce CO2 emissions. This stems from the fact that Poste Italiane, instead of using numerous vehicles to deliver to customers' multiple domiciles, can concentrate collection at a single collection point, thus reducing the number of passages and vehicle movements of the company fleet.

Furthermore, the agreement signed with the partner Italiana Petroli (IP) provides for an increase in pick-up points dedicated to purchases online, to the dispatch of pre-stamped parcels and returns from the main e-commerce sites that adhere to the PuntoPoste Network.

Regarding the partnership with Amazon, renewed in 2021 for another three years, the aim is to meet the growing demand of customers throughout Italy through innovative delivery services. In this regard, operators running an e-commerce site can activate the "Reverse Paperless" function of Poste Delivery Business, which not only makes the return service easier for the e-shopper without the need to print the shipping label, but is also beneficial for the retailer as it increases sales volume.

Additionally, in 2022 the Group continued its cooperation with Zalando, offering the possibility of using the PuntoPoste network for returns management and outward shipments. In continuity with previous years, the "Scegli Tu" (You Choose) service remained active, providing flexibility in the delivery of a shipment to the recipient, allowing it to be managed and customised even when in transit.

{378}------------------------------------------------

With a view to business development, a new postal distribution centre in Viterbo was inaugurated in the last quarter of 2022, and is expected to handle very large volumes, averaging around 255,000 kg of "ordinary" mail and around 700,000 "items" of signed mail and parcels per year. The centre was designed and built in accordance with the "Joint Delivery", the delivery model introduced throughout the province that guarantees the delivery of mail and parcels even during the afternoon hours and on Saturdays, as well as having state-of-the-art equipment to optimise the work of employees.

In addition to the Viterbo distribution centre, the Group opened other distribution centres in 2022, including Bracciano and Firenze Novoli. The new centres were designed in a functional way for "Joint Delivery" and allow a considerable increase in the volume of mail handled by Poste Italiane.

In the new distribution centres, all post officers are equipped with PDAs with which they handle ordinary mail and signatures in a quick and traceable manner. The recipient can pay from home or work, at the same time as the mail or parcel is delivered, by Postamat card, Postepay card or using debit cards from the Cirrus/Maestro circuit. The Joint Delivery model therefore passes through new structures, new organisational processes and new distribution logics. With the change towards efficiency, the Group aims to improve the quality of service and delivery times.

Additionally, Poste Italiane announced that it will open its first Post Office inside a railway station, in Catania, to contribute to the redevelopment and enhancement of the surrounding area.

With regard to the solutions offered to businesses, Poste Italiane has maintained Poste Delivery Business, an innovative service offering for sending goods and documents in Italy and abroad. As well as being modular, comprehensive and with services reserved for e-commerce, the offer integrates express courier expertise with the capillarity of the Group's network. In fact, the services made available are differentiated according to the required delivery speed (express or standard) and destination, and can be customised according to the customer's needs. For example, the "Reverse" option allows merchants to offer a simple and convenient return service, giving their customers the possibility to return purchases to Post Offices or PuntoPoste, while with the "Scegli Tu" (You Choose) option, the customer can change the destination address, reschedule the delivery at any time and view real-time updates on the expected arrival time. Furthermore, with the Offer "Prepagata" geared towards small businesses, it is possible to pay for shipments through an electronic wallet with free top-up amounts. Finally, by registering on the business.poste.it website, businesses can open an online shop window for free and be visible on the Postepay app map, so as to easily reach new customers. In 2022, the "Poste Delivery Business" offer was

enriched with a new feature that will allow sellers, users of Second Hand platforms, to send from proximity points also in paperless mode, i.e. without the need to print a label.

As part of its offerings for consumer customers, in continuation of previous years, the Company allows online parcels of up to 30 kg to be sent quickly and easily in Italy and abroad thanks to the "Poste Delivery Web" service. The customer, after registering and paying for the shipment via the website or app, can choose to take the shipment to the Post Office or the most convenient PuntoPoste showing the operator the waybill - or the 2D Code in the case of domestic shipments - generated during the purchase, or to book home collection and deliver the package directly to a courier without having to print the waybill. In this regard, from 2021, it is possible to choose instant delivery to send urgent documents and parcels, even in the evening or at weekends, with different delivery options: Instant (within 120 minutes), Today (same day), Tomorrow (next day). The service currently operates from 10am to 8pm in Rome and Milan, but will gradually be extended to the main Italian cities.

The sorting centre in Padua was awarded as part of Poste Italiane's Lean World Class mail and parcel programme for the development of a lean culture and process optimisation. The scores obtained during the audits enabled the centre, which has made sustainability and production efficiency its strong points, to reach the bronze goal.

The Padua sorting centre has been placed on the highest podium of the Lean certification for having been able to develop the synergy between production efficiency, sustainability and safety in a particularly virtuous way, through a gradual and continuous improvement fuelled also by the direct suggestions of those working on the front line. In particular, the lean path involves process efficiency, as well as a focus on safety and quality, which requires bottom-up involvement, as the operational staff is directly involved in the change and operational activities.

Sustainability

# New hubs of Poste Italiane

{379}------------------------------------------------

In addition, Poste Italiane has once again this year maintained "Poste Deliverybox Express", the service with a box included through which it is possible to ship at the same time as the purchase, or within one year at no extra cost directly from a Post Office or from one of the tobacconists enabled by the PuntoPoste network. There is a double delivery attempt, but if the addressee is absent even on the second attempt, they may collect the parcel within 10 days at the Post Office, without paying a penalty. Alternatively, it is possible to extend the delivery service to Europe and the United States using "Poste Deliverybox International Express", available in three formats and equipped with the basic customs declaration to be completed.

In continuity with previous years, in 2022, Poste Italiane promoted "Poste Delivery Now", the set of value-added services offered by the Group in collaboration with Milkman that enables e-commerce operators to offer their customers a simple and interactive shopping experience, thanks to the possibility of choosing the exact moment at which to receive the order. The offer is available in two options: the "Scheduled Delivery" mode allows flexible scheduling of delivery, choosing the day and time slot - even in the evening or on Saturdays - directly on the site where the purchase is made; with the "Same Day" formula, on the other hand, it is possible to receive the product ordered online on the same day of purchase, within an afternoon or evening time slot. Moreover, the customer, after making payment on the website and selecting the desired delivery type, can follow the shipment in real time through an advanced tracking system and, if necessary, interact with the courier. The "Poste Delivery Now" service is based on a data-driven platform that guides the delivery process and processes information quickly, ensuring a high-quality delivery service.

The home delivery service for medicines also continued to be extended to large cities and medium-small municipalities, which can take place in instant (within 90 minutes of purchase), scheduled (at the desired time) or next day (day after purchase) modes. The service is active in over 170 municipalities. In order to complete the transition to a broad-based logistics model, in 2022, Poste Italiane acquired a majority stake in Plurima, a leader in hospital logistics, and signed a partnership with Redcare, a leading company in the online sale of para-pharmaceuticals.

Finally, with the acquisition of the entire share capital of Nexive Group finalised in 2021, the Poste Italiane Group has further strengthened its position on the market, consolidating the mail sector and related logistics infrastructures to protect its sustainability.

# Innovation and digitalisation of processes

The digitalisation path undertaken by Poste Italiane has involved both the Group's offerings and its business processes, transforming the distribution model from an omnichannel perspective to allow services to be delivered in an agile manner and in line with customer needs.

The roll-out of the omnichannel strategy affected all levels of the business and, through the extension of the physical footprint and the enhancement of digital channels, it was possible to radically reverse the Group's paradigms.

In particular, the Covid-19 pandemic has fostered the implementation of business models based on an omnichannel strategy, forcing companies to adopt liquid and open operating models that combine technological innovation, data management at the service of the ecosystem, and digital and customer-oriented operations to successfully cope with sudden changes in the market.

# ~ 2 billion

will be invested in the Group's digital transformation over 2021-2024

#### Agile Lab

Agile Lab Poste Italiane acquires the majority of the Agile Lab Group

In October 2022, Poste Italiane formalised the acquisition of a 70% majority stake in the Agile Lab Group for a consideration of approximately €18 million.

Agile Lab is a company specialising in the field of data engineering and operates through three service lines - data strategy, data platform construction and related infrastructure management through which it optimises data-intensive business processes, offering innovative solutions capable of enhancing the value of customer data and making the organisational structure that manages it more efficient. In this way, the Poste Italiane Group has equipped itself with distinctive elements in the modern data industry and strengthened its ability to build data-driven businesses for the market.

{380}------------------------------------------------

Digital

Employee training

innovation in the Company

Poste Italiane, as part of its investment in the training of its employees, has promoted, in collaboration with the School of Management of the Politecnico di Milano, a course called "Digital Voices", which makes available some digital content from the "Osservatori Digital Innovation" platform of the School of Management of the Politecnico, with hundreds of contents and events created by analysts and experts for professional updating on Digital Innovation.

The objective of the programme, supported by the Digital Academy and Innovation of Poste Italiane's Corporate University in collaboration with experts in Market Data Analysis, was to involve all staff in order to foster the development and dissemination of the culture of digital innovation in the Company, also showing the opportunities and impacts that digital technologies have on people, businesses and the Public Administration.

Thanks to the use of digital platforms that create new and customised products and services by exploiting the opportunities arising from technological innovation, the Company has opened up new communication channels capable of offering its customers a seamless experience in line with their needs. The digitalisation era has made platform companies disruptive and successful business models, characterised by critical success factors - such as the joint use of exponential technologies, customer centrality, open and easily integrated platforms, guarantee of reliability and security - which have proven to be essential to efficiently manage the markets even during the pandemic.

In this scenario, Poste Italiane has positioned itself as the Distribution Platform of Choice of the Italian System to support citizens in the needs of daily life, encouraging the growth of the productive fabric and favouring the simplification of the Public Administration.

The Distribution Platform of Choice, in order to connect citizens, businesses and the Public Administration and meet their needs, has the task of addressing the emerging needs of the Country System through a Tech Ops Liquid Engine capable of enabling business evolution, articulated in four areas.

The omnichannel strategy transformed Poste Italiane into a platform company, resilient to the pandemic and the financial upheavals produced by the war in Ukraine. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company achieved a 17% increase in operating profit compared to the third quarter of the previous year, reaching, at €2.1 billion, the highest first nine-month result ever.

The Group has identified human capital as a vital resource for innovation. This is why, in addition to continuing its policy of open innovation and inorganic growth by acquiring or taking majority stakes in some of the most innovative companies and start-ups, it is also implementing a policy of "reshoring", hiring and bringing back home several "brains" that had emigrated for work. In this way, the Company contributes to the digitalisation and modernisation of the country and combines the virtualisation of services with a constant and qualified presence on the territory.

The Polis project, SPID, the launch of fibre connection services and the entry into the energy market show how Poste Italiane is a facilitator of the country's technological transformation.

Today, Poste Italiane is a platformcompany

The winning strategy of the Platform Company

{381}------------------------------------------------

It should be emphasised that to make the transformation possible, it is necessary not only to develop strategic partnerships capable of accelerating the digitalisation of the country, but also to trigger a cultural change that involves all people in a number of respects:

- z culture: it is essential to establish a generative culture in which people are strongly oriented to customers and continuous improvement;
- z collaboration: adequate collaboration tools allow the creation of internal communities that progress independently and generate value for the entire corporate ecosystem;
- z improvement: continuous improvement must be part of the DNA of all employees in order to anticipate customer needs;
- z agile: the adoption of agile methods, not only on the production chain, makes it possible to provide a rapid response to the changes that a highly digital world imposes from the outside;
- z skill: it is necessary to strengthen internal skills through the inclusion of specialised resources (e.g. architects, software engineers, etc.) in order to internalise skills and create strategic business platforms in-house, through the establishment of specialised IT factories also located throughout the territory.

# Renewing with start-ups

Poste Italiane acts for innovation

Poste Italiane underlines its commitment to innovation by participating in the sixth edition of the OPEN ITALY programme promoted by the ELIS Consortium. The Company's objective is to continue the path of innovation and digital transformation envisaged in the Strategic Plan, promoting the culture of open innovation and strengthening its leading role in digital evolution and innovation in Italy.

Start-ups today increasingly represent a player with which companies can really develop innovation, through multiple modalities and approaches. For this reason, during the OPEN ITALY programme, Poste Italiane collaborated with Bleb Technology and Discovery.

The technology developed by Bleb Technology, an Internet of Things (IOT) start-up, has found application in the logistics of the Italian Post Office. The proposed solution is based on the use of "Blebricks", low-energy wireless modular bricks that can be integrated on mobile devices for data collection, analysis and geolocation. Together with this start-up, the Company developed the I-Fast project to evaluate the possible use of this innovative technology to improve tracking systems within its Sorting and Distribution Centres for mail and parcels.

From the collaboration with Dscovr, a start-up with a team of only under 35 that provides its platform to listen to the voice of customers and help make strategic decisions on business services, the Look Around project was created. The aim is to analyse some of Poste Italiane's services in an innovative and flexible way through the experiences of its customers, as well as to raise the awareness of the importance of data in production processes and customer interactions among the people working in the Company.

The ESG advisory model

> A Guided Advisory Platform

Poste Italiane offers an advisory model focused on sustainable investments that can be consulted through an online platform. The model focuses on a product catalogue including financial criteria and ESG preferences of the client. The criteria include knowledge of the product and the client, advice and suitability, and disclosure to the client. Each product in the catalogue is associated with an ESG score on two levels, an overall pillar score and a category score, together with a representation of ESG characteristics. In the profiling process, the client's level of interest and preferences on the ESG topic is explored, based on which a minimum portfolio score is associated with the individual pillar.

Advice is given in relation to financial drivers, thanks to the introduction of specific safeguards that verify the minimum portfolio score of each pillar, according to the client preferences gathered from the MiFID Questionnaire. The control is in addition to those of the current adequacy model. Finally, as far as client disclosure is concerned, the recommendation report is enriched with indications on the consistency of the proposed products with respect to the client's ESG preferences and changes in terms of individual pillar scores, between pre- and post-recommendation portfolios. The Advisory Platform in the information sheet of each product provides information on ESG, and under the heading "product sheet", the scores for each driver (E, S, G) are broken down. The Guided Advisory Platform aims to supplement the client's existing information set with information on the ESG Synthesis Profile and the score on each individual ESG pillar.

## Integration of ESG factors into investment policies NFS

The growing popularity of sustainable finance and the expansion of responsible investment testify that the integration of ESG considerations has now become a strategic axis, and that institutional investors have a duty to work towards the creation of long-term sustainable value.

This principle has, for years now, underpinned the responsible investment approach that the Poste Italiane Group has adopted and implemented in the investment activities of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita. In fact, the Group has long integrated this vision into its strategy, translating the principles of sustainability into all the sectors in which it operates, including the financial sector, strong in its conviction that, thanks to effective investment processes, the asset management and insurance sectors can help protect society, promote innovation and support economic growth.

Poste Italiane believes that the integration of ESG risks and opportunities in the management of investment portfolios can provide a concrete response to the social and environmental needs expressed by society, positively influencing the entire Country System

In order to define a holistic approach for the integration of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") considerations into investment activities, as of 2019, a path was undertaken to develop the strategies and general approach of responsible investment for the Group's financial companies, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita. The first step along this path is the formal commitment to integrate ESG criteria into investment activities, following the two companies' signing of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). This is an international network of investors, promoted by the United Nations, whose aim is to encourage the integration of ESG issues within their investments and the companies they invest in, proposing a long-term vision in the interests of the signatories, the

MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

economy, the environment and society. The commitment made is not limited to the integration of ESG criteria, but also translates into a form of accountability with respect to policies and to the ESG integration processes adopted by signatories, who are obliged to report on progress in implementing the responsible investment approach after stipulation and on an annual basis. This step is therefore consistent not only with the Group's perspective that the inclusion of ESG issues in investment processes is necessary to pursue long-term sustainable performance and reduce portfolio risk, but also with the principles of transparency and integrity in conduct.

Festival of Sustainable Development Poste Italiane participated to the Festival of Sustainable Development represented by the CEO of BancoPosta Fondi SGR, bringing its experience in sustainable development and as an institutional partner of the event

In Poste Italiane's vision, an important contribution to the dissemination of sustainable development models and the achievement of ESG objectives from an international perspective is possible through dialogue with issuers where Group companies choose to invest, involving them in initiatives dedicated to the management of ESG criteria. In line with this conviction, in 2022, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita renewed their commitment to engagement as a pillar of ESG integration strategies in their investment processes, taking part in collaborative initiatives, with the aim of fostering the achievement of concrete results through the shared mobilisation of resources, in line with the guidelines governing the exercise of voting rights and engagement activities.

The last few years have seen increasing regulation at the European level in the area of sustainable finance, thanks to regulations enacted by the legislature with the aim of redirecting capital flows towards sustainable investments and promoting transparency and long-term vision in economic and financial activities.

During 2022, regulatory technical standards were defined. "RTS", Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288) governing the presentation and content of the disclosures required under Regulation (EU) 2019/2008 ("Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation" or "SFDR") and Regulation (EU) 2020/852 ("Taxonomy Regulation").

In view of the entry into force of the RTS, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita have been called upon to adapt to the provisions, in particular by updating the disclosure in the pre-contractual documentation with the preparation of the annexes and the adaptation of the disclosure on the website for all Group products that promote environmental or social characteristics (as per Art. 8 SFDR). For these products, periodic reporting will be conducted from early 2023.

# The impact of war on markets and support for the green transition

During 2022, the financial markets and the economic outlook of all their participants - institutional investors, retail investors and corporations - were profoundly affected by the outbreak of war in Ukraine. In addition to the resulting financial instability, the huge increase in energy prices helped push up inflation rates, leading the relevant central banks to intervene by raising interest rates.

The price shocks experienced have once again underlined the urgency, also on the part of the financial and insurance sector, to accelerate the climate transition, working along global pathways of decarbonisation and promotion of clean energies, while ensuring long-term social development.

In line with this, the Poste Italiane Group, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita signed the "Business letter ahead of the publication of the RePowerEU Plan" addressed to the President of the European Commission Ursula Von der Leyen to support the European Union in ending its supply dependency on Russia and promoting the green transition by enhancing energy security and resilience.

Poste Italiane considers it fundamental to participate in dialogue with institutions, trade associations and the financial sector in order to contribute to the dissemination of sustainable finance and the promotion of sustainable development in the belief that joint action can generate more concrete results towards sustainable development

Specifically, the Group confirmed its adherence to social and environmental initiatives such as: Access to Medicine Index, aimed at raising awareness in the pharmaceutical sector and facilitating access to medicines for the world's poorest population groups in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals; Land use and Climate Working Group of the international Ceres network, which since 1989 has aimed to improve the management of emissions and natural resources through targeted engagement activities; Access to Nutrition US Index, Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI), ClimateAction 100+.

Furthermore, like before, dialogue activities on ESG issues with listed companies were carried out as part of the "Engagement" Working Group of the Forum for Sustainable Finance and Borsa Italiana's Digital Italian Sustainability Week.

In 2022, BancoPosta Fondi SGR published for the first time a report of engagement activity and voting rights exercised in the previous year in respect to the instruments held in the portfolio.

The mainstay of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita's responsible investment approaches is the system of policies and guidelines adopted by the two companies to define the ESG integration strategy in their investment activities. Similarly to what has been described for the respective Guidelines for Voting and Engagement, in 2022, both companies revised their Guidelines for Investing in Sensitive Sectors, while Poste Vita updated its Responsible Investment Policy, taking into account both the evolution of the internal approach adopted and the external context, represented by regulation, market and international standards.

During 2022, a process was undertaken to update the system of policies that define the approach for integrating ESG criteria into the investment processes of Poste Italiane, with the aim of aligning the Responsible Investment strategy with changes in the external context, the regulatory framework and best practice and to incorporate internal developments

The Responsible Investment Policy is the reference document for all stakeholders that formalises the commitment to ESG integration in investment processes on the basis of the principles considered, activities, roles and instruments in the strategy defined. This strategy is based on the principle of including the environmental, social and governance profile of issuers in investment assessment processes, with the adoption of monitoring tools to identify the presence of inadequate sustainability profiles. With this in mind, the investment policies provide for exclusion criteria that limit the investable universe of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita with respect to issuers directly involved in the production of weapons banned by UN Conventions.

#### Controversial weapons

Poste Poste Vita and BancoPosta Fondi SGR have anticipated for their own investments the prohibitions provided for by Italian law that came into force in 2022 with respect to the financing of issuers involved in the production and sale (and any activity thereto) of anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions, which were already excluded from the investable universe of the Companies in accordance with their respective Investment Policies

The policy system is complemented by guidelines defining the approach to deal with environmental, social and governance risks that may arise during the life of the investment. 

{388}------------------------------------------------

In particular, the Guideline for investment in sensitive sectors of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita responds to the need to adopt an enhanced oversight for those activities or business conducts that present a significant inherent ESG risk, by defining the appropriate criteria and processes to identify, assess and monitor exposure to issuers involved in fossil fuels, coal, animal testing and human rights violations. In addition to the general revision of the process, the criteria for identifying issuers operating in the sensitive sectors to be monitored were also evaluated in 2022, leading to the extension of the issuers involved to include companies active in the unconventional fossil fuel sector and with coal-related transport and infrastructure activities.

In parallel with the exclusion criteria and the monitoring of exposures to sectors deemed sensitive, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita consider the potential negative impacts on sustainability factors caused by investment decisions.

The proper implementation of this policy system is ensured by the dissemination and communication of these policies within the organisation, in the belief that everyone's awareness is necessary to fully incorporate the integration of ESG considerations into business activities. At the same time, the clear allocation of roles and responsibilities enables the establishment of governance that favours the fluidity of processes and the creation of focal points within the companies for the management of ESG integration, which, through central coordination, ensure the consistency of approaches with the broader sustainability strategy and objectives of the Poste Italiane Group.

BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita promote the integration of ESG criteria within them, including through the adoption of an incentive system that includes, among the main performance drivers, parameters related to the achievement of the Poste Italiane Group's strategic guidelines on ESG issues and, in particular, the specific objectives defined in the area of sustainable finance.

#### Streams of information

BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita integrated portfolios analysis tools within their information systems in order to integrate ESG data and to continuously monitor ESG KPI

# ESG monitoring

In line with its Responsible Investment Policies, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita use a detailed and structured process to monitor investments in the portfolio, with the aim of: verifying compliance with exclusion criteria, verifying exposures to sensitive sectors, analysing the ESG profiles of the assets and assessing the appropriateness of engaging with the issuers in the portfolio By means of the principles and processes adopted, the two Group companies monitor the overall ESG profile of their investments, using assessments by specialised and internationally recognised info-providers. To this end, the portfolios of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita are periodically analysed in terms of ESG, through the now multi-year collaboration with Moody's ESG Solutions (formerly Vigeo Eiris), an agency specialising in social and environmental issues, to assess their degree of social respon-

For the Poste Vita Group, the weighted average ESG score for the investment portfolio in 2022 was 53/100 for corporate issuers and 77/100 for country issuers. The results obtained are higher than the ESG performance of the reference benchmarks, iShares MSCI World ETF equal to 42/100 for corporate investments (equity and corporate bonds) and Xtrackers Global Government Bond equal to 64/100 for government investments, confirming the high quality of the Group's investments in terms of sustainability. With respect to the CFET (Carbon Footprint Energy Transition) analysis, the weighted average carbon footprint of its portfolio was 6,160,000 tCO2 eq, with an Energy Transition score of 55/100 for corporate issuers. The comparison with the benchmark iShares MSCI World ETF is slightly unfavourable in terms of carbon footprint (equal to 5,970,529 tCO2 eq for the ETF) while the Energy Transition of Poste Vita's investments is higher than that of the index (score 45/100). Finally, the CFET of government investments was 361,194,832 tCO2 eq, and the Energy Transition score 71/100.

With reference to BancoPosta Fondi SGR, the weighted average score for the portfolios relating to the Company's direct and indirect asset management (€101 billion of assets) was 53/100 for corporate issuers and 76/100 for country issuers. BancoPosta Fondi SGR also scored higher than the ESG performance of its reference benchmarks, iShares MSCI World ETF at 42/100 for corporate investments (equity + corporate bonds) and Xtrackers Global Government Bond at 64/100 for government investments. This result confirms, once again, the high level of quality of the Group's investments in the area of sustainability. Compared to the CFET analysis, the weighted average carbon footprint of the Company's direct and indirect management portfolios (€101 billion of assets) was 5,024,749 tCO2 eq, with an Energy Transition score of 55/100 for corporate issuers. Both indicators resulted in a higher score than the benchmark iShares MSCI World ETF (5,970,529 tCO2 eq, Energy Transition score 45/100). The CFET of government investments, on the other hand, is 473,390,426 tCO2 eq, and the Energy Transition score 72/100.

These assessments are carried out in accordance with internationally recognised and disseminated standards, guidelines and norms by organisations such as the UN, ILO and OECD, and cover both corporate issuers and country issuers within portfolios managed directly or held indirectly through third-party funds.

# Offering investment products with environmental and social value

During 2022, Poste Italiane continued its efforts to expand its proposal of financial products that promote environmental or social characteristics, with a view to channelling an ever-increasing amount of capital in favour of sustainable development and meeting the demands of savers and investors attentive to the creation of positive social-environmental value through the investment products they subscribe to. In particular, the extension of the investment product offering includes, in addition to the application of the policies and guidelines implemented by Group companies, investment strategies aimed at achieving the best performance through investments selected on the basis of ESG characteristics, according to different possible approaches.

#### Poste Gestione Patrimoniale

In 2022, Poste Italiane, in collaboration with BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Moneyfarm, launched Poste Gestione Patrimoniale, a new portfolio management composed of 4 lines, the investment decisions of which take ESG factors into account

The offering of investment solutions classified under Article 8 SFDR, in line with the regulatory framework indicated by Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, stems from both the launch of new products and the revision of the investment strategies applied, with the introduction of additional ESG integration strategies.

This commitment was shared by both BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita, which, with reference to its range of insurance investment products, finalised the configuration and launch of a product with a strengthened profile in terms of ESG integration in its investment activities.

### Green Funds

Following the marketing in 2021 of BancoPosta Focus Ambiente 2027, BancoPosta Fondi SGR doubled its range of thematic products focused on the environment during the year, with the launch of BancoPosta Focus Ambiente March 2028. The funds, managed under delegation by Anima SGR, invest primarily in funds classified as products that promote environmental and/or social characteristics or pursue a sustainability objective (within the meaning of the SFDR regulation), in particular focusing on sectors and economic segments related to environmental protection such as, for example, the circular economy, water management, blue economy, renewable energy and climate transition.

With regard to insurance, there is a multi-class product whose class III component can be invested in an internal insurance fund linked to a benchmark consisting mainly of ESG indices, including, for 20%, a global equity index aiming to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% compared to the main index. In addition, Poste Vita's portfolio includes investments in alternative asset classes with an ESG component: for example, the Real Estate Diamond Eurozone Office (DEO) fund, which received a high sustainability rating from GRESB114 and was awarded the title of Green Fund, and the Real Estate Diamond Core investment fund whose underlying assets are WELL/ LEED Gold-certified real estate and which received the first green financing in the Italian real estate sector.

#### ESG funds of funds

As part of the ESG integration implemented by fund-of-funds products, BancoPosta Fondi SGR operates as an asset manager through flexible solutions based on the structuring of a proprietary model to support investment decisions. In particular, the two funds of the Universo family, BancoPosta Universo 40 and BancoPosta Universo 60, have been joined by three internal funds representing the sustainable investment options offered by the first Article 8 SFDR product launched by Poste Vita, namely "Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Dinamico", "Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Equilibrato" and "Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Sviluppo".

In all cases, the selection of funds in which to invest is based on the consideration of ESG criteria that allow for the preference of the most virtuous fund houses from the point of view of the responsible investment approach adopted and the relevant funds with investment policies aimed at selecting issuers with positive ESG profiles. The evaluation of the fund house is, in fact, a selection criterion that ensures the consistency of its commitment with that of the SGR. To this end, a proprietary ESG rating methodology has been developed that assigns an internal rating to investable UCITS based on an assessment of the degree of commitment and application of responsible investment strategies.

At the beginning of 2023, BancoPosta Fondi SGR launched the placement of its new fund Universo Tematico, which uses the same criteria for selecting UCITs as described above, while focusing investments on three mega-trends (planet, innovation, population) that will drive future changesi.

### Best-in-class ESG Funds

This category includes those investment products of BancoPosta Fondi SGR for which a delegated manager adopts a strategy aimed at selecting only issuers that meet certain acceptability thresholds, defined according to an ESG rating scale that may be elaborated by the manager himself or by the reference info-provider chosen by the delegated manager.

The offering of this type of fund already included in 2021 the Poste Investo Sostenibile, BancoPosta Selezione Attiva and BancoPosta Azionario Euro products, managed under delegation by Amundi, an operator with a strong vocation for responsible investment; these were joined in 2022 by the

# Integration of ESG factors into insurance policies

The increasing scale of environmental and social issues and the macro-trends that have emerged in recent years have led to an urgent need to ensure adequate coverage of environmental, social and governance risks as well, drawing the attention of the insurance industry and the essential role it plays in this area. In fact, through proper and effective implementation of risk management processes also by industry players, the insurance sector can contribute to the protection of the community and the sustainable development of society.

In light of these considerations, the path of ESG integration in the financial business was also initiated with reference to insurance activities and Poste Vita, on the basis of this awareness, decided to define a robust approach formalised within its "Responsible Insurance Policy", which will undergo a review process during 2022. This Policy describes the principles, objectives and processes underlying the Company's approach to managing risks and opportunities related to ESG factors within traditional insurance processes. In particular, the Policy provides the principle of the systematic assessment of environmental, social and economic context variables that have a potential impact on people, with the aim of guaranteeing adequate management of the risks involved with a view to business continuity in the long term. In order to ensure the concrete effectiveness of its initiatives, the Policy also includes articulated management and monitoring processes through the definition of predetermined roles and tools.

The early adoption of an ESG integration approach in the financial business has enabled Poste Vita to anticipate developments in the relevant market scenarios by introducing innovative and sustainable insurance products with social and environmental impacts

BancoPosta Azionario Internazionale, BancoPosta Orizzonte Reddito and BancoPosta Azionario Flessibile funds, for which the SGR reclassified them as Article 8 SFDR products, via an amendment to their respective investment policies that redefined the objective and management style of these funds. In particular, issuer selection is conducted with the aim of minimising exposure to certain business sectors and maintaining a minimum level of ESG rating per issuer or portfolio.

The transition of the three BancoPosta funds Mix 1, Mix 2 and Mix 3 from Article 6 to Article 8 SFDR will also become effective in the course of 2023. The investment policy will be revised to include the application of sustainable finance criteria such as the exclusion of controversial sectors and the implementation of a best-in-class strategy.

#### NFS MAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL

Since 2019, the Poste Vita Group has been a signatory to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) promoted by the United Nations, affirming its formal commitment to the inclusion of sustainability criteria relevant to the insurance sector in its decision-making processes. This commitment is also emphasised through collaboration paths with customers and partners aimed at raising awareness in this area and the promotion of synergies with bodies and institutions with the aim of bringing about widespread and cohesive action on ESG issues

# Insurance products with social and environmental value

The Poste Vita Insurance Group, consistent with its corporate objectives, defines and markets its products pursuing the objectives of enhancing the social role of insurance protection and inclusiveness facilitating economic affordability. For this reason, the Group develops insurance solutions that, on the one hand, encourage the adoption of sustainable and responsible behaviour by its policyholders and, on the other, are functional to the mitigation of ESG risks. During the development phase of its offering, the Group is 

{391}------------------------------------------------

committed to including more vulnerable social groups that need greater attention, such as younger and older people, and people with particular illnesses. Specifically, in the area of individual pension plans, Poste Vita offers special complementary forms, accessible also to the younger generations, who find themselves having to fill a substantial pension gap, reducing the difference between the expected basic compulsory pension and what is needed to guarantee a decent standard of living.

Moreover, in so-called risk coverages, such as term life or health policies, which play a crucial social role, the Group seeks to broaden the pool of potential policyholders as much as possible by adopting inclusive underwriting criteria. With reference to Poste Assicura, as part of its important social responsibility to bridge the insurance gap, the Company pursues the objective of providing coverage for homogeneous groups of companies and their employees.

Starting in 2021, the Group has put in place a process to evolve the services and functionalities available to customers on the main digital channels (Insurance Reserved Area and BancoPosta app) with respect to life and protection policies. It is thanks to this update that policyholders have the possibility of viewing, in their Private Insurance Area, the summary of the characteristics of the insurance product they have subscribed to and of activating additional services, such as, for life policies, the possibility of requesting partial or total redemption before maturity or requesting the settlement of a policy close to maturity, while for protection policies the possibility of managing their claims from the opening of the claim to settlement. In the same year, as part of the evolution of Poste Italiane's advisory model, an experimental phase was launched, as part of the distribution strategy for insurance investment products (Multi-class and Class I policies), of remote offerings through the dispatch by the BancoPosta distributor, in the reserved area of customers, of personalised advice tailored to their profile. In this way, customers have the possibility of finalising the remote consultations they receive online via "Firma Elettronica Avanzata - FEA" (Advanced Electronic Signature). This new mode of offering, which was included in most of the products in the catalogue in 2022, alongside the offering at Post Offices, confirms the multi-channel approach followed by the Group to improve the customer experience.

In line with its strategic objectives, during 2022, the Poste Vita Group continued the evolution of its range by considering the development of solutions that allow it to access the opportunities offered by the financial markets, including by seizing the return opportunities arising from investments in securities with positive ESG profiles. In particular, in May 2022, Poste Vita launched the placement of the first product in its range classified as a product that promotes features within the meaning of EU Regulation 2019/2088 ("SFDR"), namely "Poste Progetto Valore 360": in addition to satisfying the needs of customers oriented towards more sustainable investment choices, this product was designed to offer customers a 360-degree advisory service, which responds in an integrated manner to their investment needs and those of life and non-life protection, having, among others, the possibility to access in a single simplified process also "Poste Vivere Protetti", one of the insurance offers offered by Poste Assicura in the area of protection most recognised by customers, which aims to provide an integrated and modular solution of protection, assistance and services in the areas of the person, property and assets.

"Poste Progetto Valore 360" is a multi-class insurance solution that provides for the allocation of the investment, according to a predefined combination, between the "Posta ValorePiù" segregated account and one of the internal insurance funds, which operate with the objective of achieving growth of the invested capital, namely "Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Dinamico", "Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Equilibrato" and "Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Sviluppo". Although characterised by different risk profiles, each internal fund adopts a responsible investment strategy aimed at promoting environmental and/or social characteristics.

In particular, the funds, the management of which is delegated to BancoPosta Fondi SGR, select UCITS instruments through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation process based on an analysis of the management company and an analysis of the individual UCITS, favouring those that apply at least one responsible investment strategy among the following: promotion of environmental or social characteristics, pursuit of sustainable investment objectives, or use of benchmarks with ESG characteristics.

* For reports in the corruption area, 3 have been assessed as potentially relevant to corruption; in particular, 3 reports were found to be unfounded, of which 1 with reference to 31 December 2019 was closed in 2020.

** The decision-making measures with regard to confirmed reports are referred to the competent corporate functions or bodies, from time to time on the basis of the organisational responsibilities assigned. The functions involved in decision-making are different from the functions that are part of the Whistleblowing Committee (CW). For cases involving senior personnel, the CW shall report this to the competent corporate/social bodies, ensuring that they are informed and kept up-to-date on the developments of the initiatives implemented. If the Whistleblower is jointly responsible for the violations he/she has reported, the reporting system of Poste Italiane and of the Group Companies provides for a privileged treatment for the latter with respect to the other jointly responsible persons, in accordance with the applicable rules.

*** Of 37 reports found to be confirmed, 30 relate to Poste Italiane SpA. Of these 30 reports:

- 1 was found to be critical, due to compliance risks;

- 11 were of a material level, due to: negligent behaviour by persons with organisational responsibilities, control systems with evident malfunctions attributable to specific significant risks, significant administrative, managerial or operational impacts;

- 18 were of insignificant level, due to non-critical or insignificant reports.

On the subject of critical level reporting:

- A number of critical issues and violations were reported concerning: working hours, recognition of overtime, workplace safety, training for the safe driving of company vehicles, confusion and disorganisation, irregularities in the tracking of priority mail, delivery of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), piles of waste of all kinds abandoned in the yard, and others. A potential impact was found under Legislative Decree 231/01 concerning the malfunctioning of mopeds, the delivery and use of PPE and the presence of waste for disposal. The management defined specific action plans on the anomalies detected.

Concerning relevant level alerts:

- Reports of negligent behaviour on the part of persons with organisational responsibilities (post officers wore non-compliant accident shoes) were handled through follow-up audits, which did not reveal any critical situations in the working environment of the CD. The corrective actions taken consisted of equipping all CD post officers with the correct footwear.

- The report due to intimidating behaviour (the manager allegedly took intimidating attitudes in particular towards CTD staff who approached the union in question regarding contractual demands) was handled through follow-up audits that did not reveal any critical situations in the CD's working environment. The corrective actions included management interventions carried out following the report, which helped to improve the internal climate.

Regarding non-significant level alerts:

- The report of anti-union behaviour (the manager of a delivery centre engaged in anti-union behaviour towards a trade union organisation active at the centre) was handled through follow-up audits that did not reveal any critical situations in the working environment of the CD. The corrective actions included management interventions carried out following the report, which helped to improve the internal climate.

- The reports due to control systems with evident malfunctions attributable to specific significant risks (several anomalies were found that endangered the health of workers and the regular performance of work activities, including the malfunctioning of the ventilation system and the open red fire-fighting box with no protective glass) were handled through follow up checks that did not reveal further critical situations in the working environment. The corrective actions included the resolutions of the anomalies detected.

****** With reference to the Italian jurisdiction, in relation to the difference between income taxes accrued on company profits/losses and taxes paid, although two macro-phenomena appear to have emerged for 2022, such as the recognition of an ACE refund relating to FY2013 deriving from the filing of a refund petition and the tax effect deriving from the non-deductible provision for the liability underlying the tax credits issue, the final effect on the tax rate is substantially offset.

** The trend of involvement shows a decline in 2022 as the 'InEvidenza' survey, a listening programme on internal communication aimed at the entire corporate population, was not carried out. The survey was not carried out as it is periodic and not annual. Therefore, net of this survey the trend is in positive variance.

** The target set for 2022 is 16%.

#### Employee assessment systems

| Percentage of employees by type of assessment (%) | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
|---------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|
| Management by objectives (MBO)*                   | 94   | 96   | 96   |
| Multidimensional performance assessment**         | 91.1 | 96.2 | 97.4 |
| Comparison of employees in the same category***   | 0    | 0    | 0    |

* In the field of Human Resources, management by objectives is a method of staff evaluation based on the results achieved against fixed objectives, and not on the competences expressed. The figures have as target value the entire population of the Poste Italiane Group. The percentages refer to the resources assessed in the reference year and therefore the resources excluded from the calculation are those that cannot be assessed due to long absence (for 2022 with reference to the assessment year 2021 the number of N.A. is approximately 3,800 resources, while, for the 2021 evaluation year, 3 managers are excluded from the multidimensional evaluation, indicated as "not assessable").

** The percentage refers to the total managerial population assessed in the 180° assessment process compared to the total assessable (for 2022 with reference to the 2021 evaluation year, 1,296 employees evaluated by colleagues out of 1,330 assessable). For 2022 (performance 2021), the multidimensional evaluation is not only the 180° process (assessment of the boss and colleagues) but for about 179 managers, the overall assessment is the contribution of the direct boss, colleagues and co-workers (360° assessment).

*** The comparison of employees belonging to the same category, which refers to a system in which employees are systematically compared in relation to their colleagues of the same professional level, belonging to the same team/function, is not applicable to Poste Italiane's model.

#### Workforce trends

| Workforce trends                 | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |
|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total turnover rate (%)*         | 6.90   | 7.90   | 6.30   |
| Voluntary turnover rate (%)*     | 6.30   | 7.20   | 5.50   |
| Average cost of FTEs hired (€)** | 36,200 | 36,000 | 35,700 |

* The turnover rate was calculated on the basis of the number of FTEs leaving the Group as a proportion of the total workforce for year n-1. The voluntary turnover rate is FTEs leaving the Group voluntarily or year n as a proportion of the total workforce for year n-1.

** The average per capita annual cost of new hires regards all types of contract (permanent, fixed-term, executives, etc.). The per capita figure takes into account the following elements: fixed remuneration, ancillary remuneration (performance bonus, overtime, various allowances, etc.) mainly in addition to the contributions/employee termination benefits on the first two elements, but does not take into account: canteen voucher, travel costs (trains, planes, hotels, etc.) and company car because they do not fall within the scope of the cost of labour. The average cost for FTEs hired refers to the Parent Company.

* No. of workplace injuries divided by the number of hours worked multiplied by 1,000,000. The rate is calculated for permanent and flexible personnel.

** A work-related accident that involves absence from work greater than or equal to 40 days and leads to an injury from which the worker cannot recover, does not recover or cannot realistically be expected to recover fully and return to the pre-accident state of health. It excludes deaths.

*** The trend in the number of occupational accidents of the Parent Company was also observed through the application of a three-year moving average, using accident data, gross Covid, from 2018 to 2022. This metric makes it possible to determine the trend of the accident phenomenon by mitigating the distorting effects of exceptional events (pandemic), as well as to observe the effectiveness of management actions with a medium to long term time horizon and aimed at containing the risk factors controllable by the company (e.g. progressive adoption of the Lean methodology in sorting centres). Specifically, the calculation was made considering a total period of five years (2018 - 2022) and the average of three consecutive three-year periods (18-19-20 / 19-20-21/ 20-21-22), comparing quarterly data and the cumulative since the beginning of the year. FY 2020, 2021 and 2022 are thus to be understood correspondingly as FY 18-19-20, FY 19-20-21 and FY 20-21-22.

**** With reference to 2022, the total number of injuries is influenced by employees who contracted the Covid-19 virus, to the extent of 8,874 men and 12,548 women, for a total of 21,422 events considered as occupational injuries. In this regard, as can be seen through the indicator 'Occupational accidents net of Covid-19 cases', the figure for accidents recorded in 2022 shows an increase compared to 2021 due to the predominant impact of Covid-19 cases (out of 27,302 accidents, 21,422 are related to Covid infection).

***** Accident occurring during the normal journey between home and place of work or during the worker's normal journey to the place where meals are usually taken, if there is no company canteen. Moreover, even during the normal journey that the employee has to make to go from one place of work to another, in the case of relations with several employers.

* No. of workplace injuries divided by the number of hours worked multiplied by 1,000,000. The rate is calculated for permanent and flexible personnel.

** A work-related accident that involves absence from work greater than or equal to 40 days and leads to an injury from which the worker cannot recover, does not recover or cannot realistically be expected to recover fully and return to the pre-accident state of health. It excludes deaths.

*** The trend in the number of occupational accidents of the Parent Company was also observed through the application of a three-year moving average, using accident data, gross Covid, from 2018 to 2022. This metric makes it possible to determine the trend of the accident phenomenon by mitigating the distorting effects of exceptional events (pandemic), as well as to observe the effectiveness of management actions with a medium to long term time horizon and aimed at containing the risk factors controllable by the company (e.g. progressive adoption of the Lean methodology in sorting centres). Specifically, the calculation was made considering a total period of five years (2018 - 2022) and the average of three consecutive three-year periods (18-19-20 / 19-20-21 / 20-21-22), comparing quarterly data and the cumulative since the beginning of the year. FY 2020, 2021 and 2022 are thus to be understood correspondingly as FY 18-19-20, FY 19-20-21, FY 20-21-22.

**** With reference to 2022, the total number of injuries does not take into consideration employees who contracted the Covid-19 virus, to the extent of 8,874 men and 12,548 women, for a total of 21,422 events considered as occupational injuries. In this regard, the figure for accidents recorded in 2022 shows a decrease compared to 2021, highlighting the effectiveness of the initiatives undertaken by the Company in the field of occupational health and safety.

***** Accident occurring during the normal journey between home and place of work or during the worker's normal journey to the place where meals are usually taken, if there is no company canteen. Moreover, even during the normal journey that the employee has to make to go from one place of work to another, in the case of relations with several employers.

* Data reported refer to permanent personnel, the exclusion of flexible personnel from the performance assessment process is due to the fact that the annual life cycle of the performance assessment process cannot be reconciled with the timing of flexible contracts. The table also includes the data of Group companies with the exception of the data of Poste Air Cargo, as it is not possible to make a comparison of professional levels due to contract differences. The 2022 figures also do not include approximately 3,800 personnel who cannot be assessed due to a lengthy absence from work, for whom it is not possible to express an annual assessment. These resources are, however, included in the process of assigning annual objectives for the coming year.

** Emission factors used for conversion of fuels to CO2 e: LPG for 2020 1.56 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2020), for 2021 1.56 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2021) and for 2022 1.56 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2022). Diesel for 2020 2.54 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2020), for 2021 2.51 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2021) and for 2022 2.56 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2022). Natural gas for 2020 2.02 kg CO e/m3 (source DEFRA 2020), for 2021 2.02 kg CO2 e/m3 (source DEFRA 2021) and for 2022 2.02 kg CO2 e/m3 (source DEFRA 2022). Petrol for 2020 2.17 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2020), for 2021 2.19 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2021) and for 2022 2.16 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2022). The target expected for the year 2022 is 155,000 tCO2 e. In this regard, the Group's priority in 2022 was to limit the natural increase in emissions compared to the two-year period 2020- 2021, dictated by the resumption of activities following the lifting of restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic and which had limited operations in several respects in the previous two years.

*** Poste Italiane purchases certificates of renewable origin for 99% of its electricity consumption. The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards envisage two calculation methods for Scope 2 emissions – the location-based method and the market-based method. The Market-based method (methodology used by Poste Italiane) is based on CO2 emitted by the energy suppliers from whom the organisation purchases, through a contract, electricity (in this case, certificates of guarantee of origin from renewable energy sources) and for the remaining 1% emission factors from the national electricity grid (emission factor for the calculation of the Market-based method for: 2022 0.457 kg CO2 e/kWh, source European Residual Mixes 2021, for 2021 0.459 kg CO2 e/kWh, source European Residual Mixes 2020, for 2020 0.466 kg CO2 e/kWh, source European Residual Mixes 2019). Conversion factors used to convert thermal energy into CO2 e: for 2020, 0.17 Kg CO2 e/kWh, for 2021, 0.17 Kg CO2 e/kWh and for 2022, 0.17 Kg CO2 e/kWh. The target set for 2022 is 3,000 tCO2 e.

The Location-based method, on the other hand, is based on average emission factors for regional, sub-national or national power generation. Applying the Location-based the total Group emissions of Scope 2 in 2020 150,168 tCO2 e, in 2021 142,966 tCO2 e and in 2022 139,206 tCO2 e (emission factor for the calculation of the Location-based method 0.315 kg CO2 e/kWh, source: ISPRA 2022).

**** Emission factors used for conversion of fuels to CO2 e: Jet fuel for 2020 2.54 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2020), for 2021 2.55 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2021) and for 2022 2.55 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2022). The target expected for the year 2022 is 280,000 tCO2 e, an increase compared to 2021 as a result of a gradual outsourcing of transport. The increase recorded, however, is small compared to the target set.

* The decrease in consumption of Diesel, LPG, Natural Gas and the increase in consumption of Petrol are due to several factors. As far as natural gas is concerned, due to the high price increase at the pump for Bifuel vehicles, the use of the petrol tank was favoured over that of gas. In addition, the fleet renewal plan includes the replacement of all LPG vehicles and all Diesel vans and sedans (no longer on the market) with the more powerful Hybrid engines. Finally, the reduction in the number of vans and trucks for transport services continues due to the increasing outsourcing of these services. Applying the Location- based the total emissions attributable to the corporate road fleet of Scope 2 in 2020 114 tCO2 e, in 2021 117 tCO2 e and in 2022 555 tCO2 e.

| Total emissions tCO2<br>e | 13,929* | 32,940** | 28,370*** |

- * The value indicated refers to the estimate of the polluting emissions generated by the home-work travel of Poste Italiane employees applied in the offices of more than 300 resources which, at present, amount to 38 located in 18 cities in Italy, for a sample of 24,316 total resources.
- ** The value of the polluting emissions generated by the home-work commutes indicated (2021 32,940 tCO2 e) refers to the estimate of the polluting emissions generated by the home-to-work commutes of Poste Italiane employees applied in offices with over 100 resources located in municipalities with population over 50,000 inhabitants which, at present, amount to 146 located in 73 cities of the national territory, for a sample of about 39,348 total resources. As a result of Law No. 77 of 17/07/2020, the scope of the analysis has changed compared to 2020 when, instead, the observation was intended for the 38 offices with more than 300 employees located in 18 cities for a sample of 24,316 resources. The 2021 analysis also took into account the Company's adoption of the agile working mode on the reduction of home-work kilometres travelled, applied to help contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus and taking into account the guidelines of the competent authorities, adopted by 80% of staff (12.5% of the company population) from January to September 2021 and by 50% in October-December 2021; the calculation was carried out excluding 17 cities for which the redemption rate of the questionnaire was not sufficient to allow an estimate of the pollutants emitted in the home-work commute. It should be noted that, in implementation of the provisions of the aforementioned Act, the methodology applied is that proposed by the new MITE-MIMS Guidelines introduced in August 2021, which therefore differs from the methodology used for the 2020 analysis.
- *** The value indicated refers to the estimate of the polluting emissions generated by the home-work commute of Poste Italiane employees and refers to all the Group offices subject to the home-work commute analysis in 2022 (offices > 100 employees located in municipalities with a population over 50,000 inhabitants) which, at present, amount to 140 located in 77 municipalities of the national territory, for a sample of about 40,363 total resources. This is due to the provisions of Law No. 77 of 17/07/2020. The calculation also takes into account the impact of smart working on the reduction of home-work kilometres travelled (adopted for 50% of staff with 2 returns per week). Consistent with the provisions of Articles 18 et seq. of Law no. 81/2017 and the trade union agreements signed, this modality will continue, as of 01/04/2022, on the basis of individual agreements between the Company and the worker with 3 returns per week of the entire company staff population (13% of the company population, 123,000 employees - Source RUO as of 01/02/2022). It should be noted that the methodology applied is that proposed by the new MITE-MIMS Guidelines.

* The Group's Scope 3 financed emissions input data (absolute emissions, WACI and relative breakdowns by industry and region) are produced and verified by Moody's rating agency. The analysis in 2022 considered an amount of Assets under Management (AuM - corporate issuers) amounting to €63,107,022,142.85 corresponding to 90.21% of the Group's total AuM (corporate issuers).

** Financed emissions: category of emissions associated with the Company's investments in the reporting year, currently not included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. These emissions are categorised as a downstream Scope 3 category (Scope 3 Category 15, GHG Protocol). Absolute emissions: absolute greenhouse gas emissions associated with the company's portfolio, expressed in tonnes.

*** Weighted average carbon intensity of a portfolio (WACI) obtained by calculating the carbon intensity (Scope 1 + 2 emissions / mln € revenue) for each company in the portfolio and calculating the weighted average for the weight of the company in the portfolio.

* The customer experience of Business Units is measured every six months through surveys which measure the advisability of Poste Italiane's products and services based on the metrics of Net Promoter Score (NPS).

In terms of channels, the indicator used is the Customer Effort Score (CES), which records the ease of access to services.

The customer samples involved in the customer experience surveys represent the related universe.

The Business Units involved in the customer experience surveys are: BancoPosta (Retail, SME and Large Customers); Mail, Communication and Logistics (SMEs and Large Customers); Poste Vita (Retail). The sales and customer care channels involved regard respectively the post office channel and the Contact Centre.

With reference to the method used to measure customer satisfaction, the surveys use a scale of 1 to 10 to measure satisfaction. The percentages shown include customers who have answered 7-8 and 9-10 in the surveys carried out. Scores of 9-10 in the NPS/CES surveys reflect customers who are "promoters" (NPS) and "enthusiasts" (CES). ** The target set for 2022 is 82.60%.

* In 2022, with respect to detected incidents of violation of privacy, in 26 cases, the competent internal function that investigated the breaches forwarded the files to the Human Resources function for appropriate action against the employees involved. In the remaining cases, no sanctions were imposed on Poste Italiane staff because the violations occurred due to external attacks and/or human error.

#### IT security and cyber security breaches

| Total amount of fines /penalties paid in relation to IT security breaches and other IT security<br>incidents (€) | 0    | 0    | 0     |

* The number of incidents is lower than in the previous year. In connection with the Russia-Ukraine crisis, levels of monitoring and attention to security events were raised and cyber intelligence activities strengthened in order to prevent or promptly intercept potential attacks cyber against the Poste Italiane group. Specific measures were also put in place to minimise the attack surface and the impact of a possible attack on Poste Italiane's customer base. Timely and effective business continuity and crisis management is ensured by the application of a Business Continuity Plan and a Crisis Management Plan, which are an integral part of a framework that also includes a Disaster Recovery Plan, a Communication Plan, a Test Plan, and operational procedures and instructions.

The underlying causes of IT incidents and breaches that occurred during 2022 are mainly attributable to external attacks. In particular, the attack was aimed at Poste Italiane employees with the objective of carrying out identity theft and consequently accessing company systems. In this regard, it should be pointed out that since they are not attributable to negligence on the part of the staff of Poste Italiane, no disciplinary measures have been taken against the employees. However, in the course of the year, the Group launched a series of initiatives aimed at reducing IT security incidents related to credential compromise, such as the large-scale implementation of user identity verification systems using 2-factor authentication systems.

### Alternative performance indicators

In keeping with the guidelines published by the European Securities and Markets Authority on 5 October 2015 (ESMA/2015/1415), in addition to the financial disclosures required by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), Poste Italiane has included a number of indicators in this Report that have been derived from them. These provide management with a further tool for measuring the Group's performance.

As part of the transition to the new accounting standard IFRS 17, the Poste Italiane Group is currently evaluating adjustments to certain alternative performance indicators used for the representation and communication of results, as well as the integration of new indicators starting from the Interim Report at 31 March 2023

The following alternative performance indicators are used:

ALLOCATED CAPITAL: an equity indicator represented by the sum of Group equity net of fair value and cash flow hedge reserves. The indicator includes coupons accrued on the hybrid perpetual bond and dividends to shareholders accrued in the current year.

NET WORKING CAPITAL: this indicator represents the sum of inventories, trade receivables and other receivables and assets, current tax assets, trade payables and other liabilities, and current tax liabilities.

This indicator is also shown separately for each Strategic Business Unit.

NON-CURRENT ASSETS: this indicator represents the sum of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investments measured using the equity method. This indicator is also shown separately for each Strategic Business Unit.

NET INVESTED CAPITAL: this indicator represents the sum of non-current assets and net working capital, deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, provisions for risks and charges and employee termination benefits. This indicator is also shown separately for each Strategic Business Unit.

CET 1 CAPITAL: consists of Primary Tier 1 capital, as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013, and includes the Capitalised Earnings Reserve created upon appropriation of assets and the Retained Earnings Reserves, taking into account the transitional regime.

CET 1 RATIO: this ratio measures the adequacy of Tier 1 capital with respect to the weighted exposure to Pillar 1 risks (operational, credit, counterparty and foreign exchange). It is the ratio of CET1 Capital to total Risk Weighted Assets (RWA).

COMBINED RATIO (net reinsurance): technical indicator of non-life business, determined as the ratio of claims and operating expenses (acquisition, collection and administrative expenses and reinsurance balance) to earned premiums, i.e. equal to the sum of loss ratio and expense ratio.

UNIT DIVIDEND (DPS): represents the amount of dividends paid by the company for each outstanding share. It is calculated as Dividends paid/Number of shares outstanding.

EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes): this is an indicator of operating profit before financial expenses and taxation.

EBIT margin: this is an indicator of the operating performance and is calculated as the ratio of operating profit (EBIT) to total revenue. This indicator is also shown separately for each Strategic Business Unit.

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation): this is an indicator of operating profit before financial expenses and taxation, and depreciation, amortisation and impairments of non-current assets.

EXPENSE RATIO: a technical indicator of non-life business, determined by the ratio of operating expenses (acquisition, collection, administrative expenses and reinsurance balance) to earned premiums.

FUND FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): financial indicator represented by the Group's net result, adjusted for non-monetary costs and revenues (depreciation and amortisation, Expected Credit Loss - ECL of receivables, financial expenses from discounting) and the net change in provisions for risks and severance pay. In the Mail, Parcels and Distribution SBU, the indicator is also neutralised by the IFRS 16 effect (amortisation and financial expenses) and includes financial outlays for rents.

{437}------------------------------------------------

LAPSE RATE: this is an indirect measure of customer loyalty. It is based on surrenders during the period as a percentage of average mathematical provisions of the period.

It is calculated as a percentage of Surrenders/Average mathematical reserves (linearised over 12 months in the intermediate periodic situations).

LEVERAGE RATIO: this is the ratio between Total Capital (Own Funds) and total balance sheet assets, the latter including adjustments for derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures.

LOSS RATIO: A technical indicator of non-life business, which measures the percentage incidence, with respect to earned premiums, of amounts paid and reserved for claims incurred in the year and in previous years, including related direct expenses and settlement costs.

GROUP NET DEBT/(FUNDS): the sum of financial assets, tax credits under Law no.77/2020, cash and deposits attributable to BancoPosta, cash and cash equivalents, technical provisions for the insurance business (shown net of technical provisions attributable to reinsurers) and financial liabilities.

This indicator is also shown separately for each Strategic Business Unit.

NET DEBT/(FUNDS) OF THE MAIL, PARCELS AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNIT: this is the financial debt calculated according to the scheme recommended by ESMA European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA32-382- 1138 of 4 March 2021) net of trade payables and other non-current payables with a significant implicit or explicit financing component and including the following items: non-current financial assets, tax credits under Law no. 77/2020, current hedging derivatives assets, inter-segment financial receivables and payables.

NET DEBT/(FUNDS) OF THE MAIL, PARCELS AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNIT AS PER IFRS 16: Calculated as the net financial position of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Services Strategic Business Unit excluding the financial liabilities for leasing (IFRS 16) and the fair value and cash flow hedge reserves.

AVERAGE PORTFOLIO RETURN EXCLUDING PRO-ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT (%): Yield portfolio average calculated as the ratio between interest income and average current account balances (excluding the value of pro-active portfolio management).

RWA - Risk Weighted Assets: is the indicator that measures the risk exposure of assets in accordance with Basel regulations. Risk-Weighted Assets, or RWA, are calculated by applying a weighting to assets that takes into account the level of exposure to credit, counterparty, market and operational risks.

Poste Italiane's Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFS or "Statement") for 2022 has been drafted on the basis of the 8 key sustainability pillars of the Group's ESG Strategic Plan which covers environment (E), social (S) and governance (G) issues and has been designed with the aim of generating long-term value for stakeholders.

In addition to ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 254/2016 ("Decree") through the information contained in this Chapter, conformity with the law requirements is also ensured by providing references to other sections of the Annual Report and to other company documents, when the information is already contained therein or to which reference is made for additional clarifications. In particular:

- z the corporate management and organisation model is illustrated in chapter 4 "Business model" and in the paragraphs "Integrating Sustainability into Poste Italiane's Strategy" and "Poste Italiane's Integrated Internal Control and Risk Management System", which describes the way in which the organisation, thanks to business activities, generates results aimed at achieving strategic objectives and creating value in the short, medium and long term;
- z risk management, implemented through the Group Risk Management (RMG) model based on the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework , is described in the paragraphs "Relevant Sustainability Topics for Poste Italiane" and "The Internal Control and Integrated Risks of Poste Italiane", which describes in greater detail the main non-financial risks associated with the material topics, the possible impacts and the related management methods;
- z company policies are described in the paragraph "The Group's Sustainability Policies" which sets out the general rules of conduct on which all of Poste Italiane's activities must be based. In addition, the chapter 7 "Value Creation" provides information, with regard to each material topics, on the related strategic objectives and the operating processes used to deliver on them;
- z performances are illustrated in the paragraphs of the chapter 7 "Value Creation", which describes the main initiatives for the year, and in the paragraph "Indicators tables", which shows the results achieved in the last three years.

Poste Italiane's Consolidated Non-financial Statement (NFS) has been prepared in compliance with Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016 and in accordance with the most widely used international standards: the Global Reporting Initiative's GRI Standards in accordance with the 2021 update of the Universal Standards published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Furthermore, within the 2022 NFS, for purposes other than that of complying with the requirements of Legislative Decree 254/2016, additional KPIs were integrated specific to the sector in which the Group operates, taking into consideration the indicators published by GRI - Financial Services and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). These indicators are clearly identified in the table on pages 476-477 and are to be considered additional to the disclosure prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards to meet the requirements of Legislative Decree 254/16.

The Statement is included in the Report on Operations, which in turn is contained in the 2022 Annual Report and constitutes Poste Italiane's Integrated Report, prepared in accordance with the principles included in the "International Framework", published by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).

The NFS was approved by Poste Italiane SpA's Board of Directors on 29 March 2023, pursuant to art. 3, paragraph 10 of the Decree. The NFS was approved by Poste Italiane SpA's Board of Directors on 29 March 2022, pursuant to art. 3, paragraph 10 of the Decree. The NFS, with the exception of disclosures relating to SASB, WEF, TCFD and SDGs requirements, as well as the disclosure related to the process of determining "financial materiality" and related outputs, carried out in anticipation of the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), with the scope of making an exercise of applying the concept of double materiality (as defined in Chapter 5 "Strategy"), has been subjected to a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the criteria indicated in the "International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 Revised - Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information" issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) by Deloitte & Touche SpA, which expresses its opinion in a special "Report of the Independent Auditors" contained in the document.

In order to define the contents of the NFS and thus identify the material issues to be included in the Group's Sustainability Strategy, Poste Italiane revised and refined its materiality analysis methodology, aligning it to the provisions contained in the 2021 update of the GRI standards and taking into account the provisions of the EFRAG, albeit still in draft form. The degree of detail with which material topics are treated in the reporting was determined on the basis of the significance of the related impacts, determined through the aforementioned materiality analysis process, which involved top management and the Group's stakeholders through specific engagement activities (for more information, please refer to the section 'Priority Sustainability Issues for Poste Italiane').

For each material topic, the company's management and organisational model, policies including due diligence policies, the results achieved through them and some non-financial performance indicators, as well as the related impacts on the economy, environment and people, including human rights impacts and how these impacts are managed, were reported.

Key Performance Indicators are collected on an annual basis; indicators reported refer to 2022, and where available to the 2020-2022 period as well. The qualitative and quantitative information comes from the Group's corporate information systems and from a non-financial reporting system specifically implemented to meet the requirements of the Decree. The data is based on punctual calculations and, where specifically indicated, on estimates. In particular, the estimated data regard certain items relating to energy consumption inside and outside the organisation - data regarding electricity consumption (for security purposes and relating to outsourced Data Centres), natural gas, diesel, LPG and district heating for the Group's real estate facilities - and water consumption, which was calculated on the basis of the costs incurred and the average tariff payable. Consumption linked to logistics is estimated in terms of distance travelled and/or average consumption of the means and the transported load, except for motor vehicles used in last mile logistics. Moreover, it should be pointed out that in this document the figures in millions of Euro have been rounded up or down, so the sum of the rounded amounts may not add up to the rounded total. During the period, following the update of the Poste Italiane Business Plan, the Group's targets and objectives were updated.

All GRI Standards indicators reported are shown in the GRI Content Index of this section starting on page 465.

All the data refer only to the companies consolidated using the line-by-line method for financial reporting, as indicated in the table "Scope of consolidation and highlights of investments" (Note 13 - pages 780-782). Exceptions to this scope are explicitly indicated within the document. In addition, each reported indicator always has a coverage equal to the total of the information request, net of explicit specification. The terms Poste Italiane, Group or Company are used in the NFS to refer to the Poste Italiane Group. In addition, content related to the NFS, as previously mentioned, is also indicated to make it easily identifiable, by this infographic: NFS

### 9.2 European Taxonomy Regulation

Due to the European Union's increasing focus on environmental and social sustainability issues, on 22 June 2020, published in the Official Journal of the European Union was EU Regulation No. 852/2020 (so-called Taxonomy Regulation), which establishes the criteria for an economic activity to be considered environmentally sustainable. Renewing its commitment to a rapid transition to a modern, competitive, climate-resilient, resource-efficient and resource-efficient economy in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the European Green Deal, the European Commission introduced the Taxonomy Regulation with the aim of establishing a unified classification system for sustainable activities and, at the same time, using a common language to establish a clear definition of what is 'green'.

The identification of a unified classification system based on harmonised criteria at EU level to define an environmentally sustainable activity is the most important action within the Action Plan to finance sustainable growth. To this end, the Taxonomy Regulation is set in a challenging context undertaken by the European Union to boost the contribution of the financial sector in supporting the European Union's climate and sustainable development agenda.

EU Regulation No. 852/2020 establishes the basis for the Taxonomy, the environmental objectives and the ways in which an economic activity can be defined as environmentally sustainable, and identifies itself at European level as a tool that can help:

- z companies to evaluate their activities, to adopt corporate policies aimed at greater environmental sustainability and to report more comprehensively and comparably to their stakeholders;
- z investors in the integration of sustainability issues within investment policies and to understand the environmental impact of the economic activities in which they invest or want to invest;
- z public institutions to define and improve their ecological transition policies.

Furthermore, the Taxonomy Regulation allows market participants to have an unambiguous definition of sustainable assets to use in their decision-making processes and at the same time promotes the transparency of financial markets with respect to sustainability issues in terms of investment choices, providing investors with adequate information to steer capital flows towards sustainable choices.

In compliance with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation, companies subject to the obligation to publish a non-financial statement must provide information on how and to what extent their business activities are 'eco-sustainable'.

According to the Taxonomy Regulation, an economic activity can be defined as environmentally sustainable (aligned to the EU Taxonomy) if it fulfils the following criteria:

- z contributes substantially to the achievement of one or more of the six environmental objectives defined in the regulation;
- z does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives (Do Not Significant Harm DNSH);
- z is carried out in compliance with minimum safeguards.

In this regard, the European Commission has defined a set of requirements (so-called technical screening criteria) that must be met by operators carrying out economic activities impacting on the objectives defined by the Taxonomy.

{455}------------------------------------------------

In relation to the way in which the environmental sustainability information that financial and non-financial companies are required to provide is presented, EU Delegated Regulation No. 2178/2021, which incorporates the provisions set out in the Taxonomy Regulation, specifies the content, methodology and presentation methods of the so-called 'key performance indicators' or 'KPIs' to be reported and the qualitative information that must accompany them. The delegated act specifies in particular that:

- z Non Financial Undertakings are required to report the percentage of their turnover, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenditure (Opex) associated with economic activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy;
- z Financial Undertakings must report the share of investments/financing associated with economic activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy118.

Pursuant to Art. 10 of the Delegated Regulation, for the second year of reporting there is a differentiation in the presentation of key performance indicators between Non-Financial Undertakings and Financial Undertakings; in fact, as of 1 January 2023, Non-Financial Undertakings must disclose the share of their turnover, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenditure (Opex) associated with economic activities aligned with the Taxonomy, i.e. included in the list of activities that comply with all the general conditions defined by the Taxonomy, including the assessment of the technical screening criteria defined, for this reporting year, in Annex I and Annex II of the Technical Delegated Acts to the Taxonomy Regulation - substantial contribution to Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. On the other hand, for Financial Undertakings, the process of aligning their business activities will come into effect as of 1 January 2024; thus, for another year of reporting, Financial Undertakings will have to show the share of investments/financing eligible to the Taxonomy, i.e. included in the list of activities considered to date by the Taxonomy as potentially environmentally sustainable with reference to the first two objectives defined by the European Commission.

<sup>118.</sup> It should be noted that the legislation qualifies financial companies by distinguishing between credit institutions, asset managers, investment firms and insurance/reinsurance companies, providing different metrics and reporting methods for each category.

{456}------------------------------------------------

### European Taxonomy: methodological Approach to the Reporting Process

The Poste Italiane Group has adopted a methodological approach that provides an adequate and representative disclosure of its business profile. In particular, this approach was introduced following a careful analysis of the economic activities as well as of the regulatory framework of reference, as part of the commitment to play an active part in achieving the European Union's Sustainable Development Goals.

In line with the principle of transparency towards the market that has always been followed, Poste Italiane has provided for a reporting method capable of providing evidence of both industrial operations (Non Financial Undertakings) and financial operations (Financial Undertakings). In particular, pursuant to the regulations in force relating to the reporting methods of mixed groups, Poste Italiane has decided to pursue a dual reporting method: within this document, in fact, disclosure is made on a consolidated basis of the KPIs envisaged for the Non Financial Undertakings119, as well as of the KPIs envisaged by the regulations, and deemed to be more representative of the financial and insurance business of the Poste Italiane Group, for the Financial Undertakings. This choice was guided by the conviction that this method of reporting can contribute to completing the information framework for both investors and, more generally, Poste Italiane's stakeholders, enabling them to have information consistent with the regulatory provisions in force, which are still being completed.

The process of reporting on the information requirements outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation involved a careful analysis of the regulations and related developments, in order to identify, assess and consolidate the qualitative and management and/ or accounting information necessary for the relative calculation of the indicators representing alignment for Non-Financial Undertakings and eligibility for Financial Undertakings. This process, therefore, involved numerous functions of the Group that own the data, requiring the participation of the main business structures to identify the activities aligned with and eligible for the Taxonomy, in compliance with the related eco-sustainability criteria associated with the individual economic activities being assessed, as well as the related management of the data collection process.

Finally, in line with the previous year, it was deemed appropriate and efficient to request the support of the external provider Moody's in order to process certain data necessary for the calculation of the KPIs of the Financial Undertaking. At the same time, also for this year, with the aim of guaranteeing a correct reconciliation with the economic and financial figures shown in the financial reporting, the eligibility analyses carried out by the external provider Moody's on potentially eco-sustainable investments were accompanied by the constant monitoring by the Administration, Finance and Control function.

### Eco-sustainable business activities of Poste Italiane

The indicators required by the regulations for Non-Financial Undertakings are shown below, which, as previously outlined, in order to avoid any potential risk of double counting, have been calculated on a consolidated basis, net of intra-group items, thus considering the same scope of consolidation as the consolidated financial statements.

In line with the regulatory requirements concerning the manner in which the key performance indicators for Non-Financial Undertakings, presented in table form are respectively the share of turnover, of capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenditure (Opex) arising from products or services associated with aligned, eligible but not aligned and non-taxonomy eligible economic activities.

In connection with the taxonomy alignment analyses performed for this financial year, pursuant to Article 3 (c) of Regulation 852/2020, the Group conducted its business activities in compliance with the minimum safeguards120, i.e. in line with the OECD Guidelines, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the principles and rights set forth in the eight core conventions identified in the International Labour Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights.

Furthermore, it should be noted that, with reference to the disclosure pursuant to Article 8 paragraphs 6 and 7 of EU Delegated Regulation No. 2178/2021, which provides for the use of the templates provided in Annex XII for the disclosure of nuclear and fossil gas activities, all the templates have been omitted as they are not representative of the company's activities.

For more details on compliance with the four pillars of the Platform on Sustainable Finance, see "Integrity and transparency".

{457}------------------------------------------------

Finally, in line with the latest FAQ published by the European Commission121, for the first year of alignment reporting, publication of comparative data with the previous year of disclosure is not required.

### Turnover KPIs

As shown in Table 1: Share of turnover derived from products or services associated with economic activities aligned with the Taxonomy - Disclosure for the year 2022, the share of turnover derived from economic activities that are aligned, eligible but not aligned, and not eligible for the Taxonomy has been identified.

The share of turnover associated with economic activities aligned with the taxonomy is 0.7%, while the share of eligible but nonaligned economic activities is 8.9%; thus, the share of non-eligible turnover is equivalent to 90.4%.

The KPIs reported here refer to the revenues associated with the Strategic Business Units 'Mail, Parcels and Distribution' and 'Insurance Services', of which delivery and transport activities and premiums on non-life policies for the underwriting of climate-related perils were taken into account, respectively.

In particular, with reference to the "Mail, Parcels and Distribution" SBU, the portion of revenues (Note C1 "Revenues from mail, parcels and other" Consolidated Financial Statements) referable to economic activities included in "6.6 - Road haulage services" - climate change mitigation objective, as it is more in line with the nature of the same economic activities; on the other hand, with reference to the "Insurance Services" SBU, revenues (Note C2 "Net revenues from Financial Services") from premiums on nonlife policies pertaining to "10.1 - Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils" - climate change mitigation objective were evaluated.

In addition, in order to relate the Group's revenues to the revenue category subject to the alignment and eligibility analyses of road haulage services, a weighting driver was adopted based on the initial cost of the number of vehicles in the Group's corporate fleet, which therefore participate in the formation of the revenues of the "Mail, Parcels and Distribution" SBU.

Eligible revenues from the insurance business include premiums directly related to fire and other property damage policies.

In connection with the alignment analyses, by virtue of the individual technical screening criteria relating to the respective associated objectives for the economic activities under assessment, the alignment for the component of economic activities falling under "6.6 - Road haulage services" was reconciled. In fact, following a careful analysis of the management information covering the respective criteria of substantial contribution to the Climate Change Mitigation and DNSH objectives, the Group's corporate fleet vehicles, falling within the perimeter of delivery only, of category N1122 were identified that have direct (tailpipe) CO2 emissions of zero and do not significantly harm the objectives of Climate Change Adaptation, Transition to a Circular Economy and Pollution Prevention and Reduction.

Instead, with reference to the total turnover at the consolidated level, the total "Net revenues from ordinary operations" for the year 2022 was determined, as reported in the "Consolidated Statement of Profit/(Loss) for the Year" in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with IAS 1.82(a).

### KPIs of capital expenditure

The share of capital expenditure from taxonomy-aligned economic activities is 5.1%, as reported in the template (Table 2: Share of capital expenditure from products or services associated with economic activities aligned with the taxonomy - Disclosure for the year 2022), according to Annex II of Delegated Regulation No. 2178/2021. With regard, on the other hand, to the share of Capex associated with eligible but non-aligned economic activities, 17.8% was achieved in this year, thus, the share of non-eligible capital expenditure is 77.1%.

The indicators shown are capital expenditures associated with investments in the Group's corporate fleet, which are directly related to the revenues of the Strategic Business Unit 'Mail, Parcels and Distribution', and investments made in energy efficiency on the Group's buildings, which specifically refer to the installation of energy efficiency devices, electric vehicle charging stations, intelligent tools for the measurement, regulation and control of the energy performance of buildings and renewable energy technologies.

Therefore, the findings at the numerator of this KPI mainly refer to:

- z investments associated with '6.6 Road haulage services' that contribute to the environmental objective of Climate Change Mitigation;
- z Capex linked to sector '7. Building and Real Estate Activities" Climate Change Mitigation objective, with a focus on enabling activities under "7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency devices", "7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of electric vehicle charging stations in buildings (and parking spaces in buildings)', '7.5 Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for the measurement, regulation and control of the energy performance of buildings' and '7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies'.

The alignment analyses performed underlined the conformity of the assessed economic activities to the eco-sustainability criteria of the Taxonomy Regulation and the associated technical screening criteria. In this regard, activities falling within the scope of investments in the Group's corporate fleet vehicles of category N1 delivery only, as well as capital expenditures related to energy efficiency, eco-sustainable mobility, smart building and photovoltaic plants, which, respectively, by their nature, contribute substantially to the Climate Change Mitigation objective and do not significantly harm the other environmental objectives, have been subject to compliance assessment and therefore defined as aligned with the Taxonomy.

Instead, in relation to the denominator of the Capex KPI, the latter was reconciled on the basis of the sum of the gross additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recognised in this year in application of IAS 16, 38, 40 and IFRS 16, as reported in Notes A1 "Property, Plant and Equipment", A2 "Investment Property", A3 "Intangible Assets" and A4 "Rights-of-Use Assets" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to which reference should be made.

### KPIs of operational expenditure

Pursuant to Article 10 paragraph 4 of Delegated Regulation No. 2178/2021, with reference to the present financial year, the Group has identified and reported in the following Table 3: Share of operating expenses arising from products or services associated with economic activities aligned with the Taxonomy - Disclosure for the year 2022, the share of operating expenses associated with economic activities that are aligned, eligible but not aligned and ineligible for Taxonomy.

The share of Opex derived from economic activities aligned to the Taxonomy is 0.1%; the share of Opex associated with eligible but non-eco-sustainable economic activities is 2.3%, while the relevant non-eligible share is equivalent to 97.6%.

In relation to the respective alignment and eligibility analyses, the numerator of these KPIs mainly refers to direct costs strictly related to the economic activities of the Group's corporate fleet.

Therefore, in line with what was analysed for the Turnover KPI and the Capex KPI, given the nature of the same expenses achieved during the year, aligned and eligible operating expenses were assessed as directly associated with "6.6 Road Haulage Services ", which are mainly relevant to Climate Change Mitigation objectives.

In particular, as explained in the section referring to the Turnover KPI, in order to trace the Opex analysed back to the book value of the operating expenses referring to N1 category vehicles, a weighting driver was adopted based on the opening cost of the number of vehicles included in the Group's corporate fleet that participate in the expenses similar to '6.6 - Road haulage services'. Therefore, the assessment of compliance with the criteria set forth in Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation and the technical screening criteria associated with the economic activities being analysed allowed for the identification of the alignment of the operating expenses related to the N1 category vehicles of the Group's corporate fleet, whose economic activities, at the same time, consistent with the DNSH criteria, do not significantly harm the other environmental objectives of Adaptation, Transition to a Circular Economy and Pollution Prevention and Reduction.

The denominator of the Operating Expenses KPI, pursuant to Annex I of the Delegated Regulation No. 2178/2021, is defined by the non-capitalised direct costs related to research and development, building renovation, rents, maintenance, repairs and other direct expenses related to the day-to-day operation of assets incurred in this financial year.

### Eco-sustainable investments by the Poste Italiane Group

In order to ensure maximum transparency towards the market, the Group decided to also disclose the indicators provided for in the Taxonomy Regulation for Financial Undertakings. In fact, in relation to the financial operations of Asset Management and Insurance carried out by BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita respectively, the respective KPIs governed by the regulations are reported below.

As mentioned above, for financial undertakings, a reduced information content has been envisaged for the first two years of reporting, with the share of eligible and ineligible exposures being published in the Taxonomy. For this year, however, it was possible to disclose KPIs on the share of eligible and non-eligible exposures performed on the basis of actual/reported Turnover and Capex percentages derived from the counterparties, i.e. timely data that allow mandatory reporting and no longer solely based on estimates and proxies.

In line with last year's reporting year, and with the aim of ensuring a higher level of data certification and methodologically robust processing, the Group considered it appropriate to involve the external provider Moody's ESG Solutions (MESG, formerly Vigeo Eiris), specialising in ESG solutions and mapping issuers according to Taxonomy criteria. In this regard, in fact, the methodology adopted by MESG has allowed it to analyse the assets falling within the scope of application of the Technical Delegated Acts referring to the first two environmental objectives of Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change, and to use punctual eligibility data on a Turnover and Capex basis in the calculation of KPIs.

The provider's support in the analyses conducted for the purpose of reporting the various indicators enabled the screening necessary for the disclosure of the KPIs, which showed a coverage of 98.4% and 97.7% of the corporate assets held directly and indirectly by Poste Vita and BancoPosta Fondi126.

In relation to the methodology adopted by MESG, consistent with the relevant regulations, the numerator of the KPIs was defined as a function of the exposures held in the portfolio in terms of eligible economic activities to financial entities and non-financial entities subject to non-financial reporting requirements and covered by the MESG EU Taxonomy research. The denominator, on the other hand, is the sum of portfolio exposures held to counterparties within the scope of the MESG EU Taxonomy research, derivative exposures, liquidity and cash, net of sovereigns.

Therefore, with the exception of the "Share of exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers", for which KPI the total Assets under Management has been adopted as the denominator, in accordance with the regulations, for the indicators shown below it is specified that the Total Assets, corresponding to the Assets under Management net of investments in central governments, central banks and supranational issuers (sovereigns), has been used as the denominator.

Finally, for BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita, total assets represent 19% and 20% of total Assets Under Management, respectively.

### Asset Management KPIs

With a view to representing the results of the analyses conducted in an increasingly complete manner and in accordance with regulatory requirements, for the present financial year, accurate data referring to the percentages of Turnover and Capex obtained for the counterparties in the portfolio were used. Therefore, it was possible to calculate the share of eligible and ineligible Turnover-based and Capex-based investments, respectively, below:

- z taxonomy-weighted eligible investments are 13.3%;
- z the share of Capex-based eligible investments is equivalent to 6.3%.

It should also be noted that these eligibility percentages represent the results of analyses conducted on BancoPosta Fondi SGR's investments that potentially contribute to the environmental objectives of Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation.

Thus, the share of ineligible investments on a Turnover basis is 86.7%, while the share of ineligible investments on a Capex basis is 93.7%.

<sup>126.</sup> Non-hedged assets constitute a very residual share and are mainly invested in mid- and small-capitalisation companies, which, to date, have not reported the necessary data for the taxonomy. It should also be noted that the Poste Vita assets subjected to screening were deducted of the assets managed by BancoPosta Fondi SGR, in order to avoid double counting.

### Insurance KPIs

As previously reported for the KPI relating to BancoPosta Fondi SGR's asset management operations, two percentages were derived for the Poste Vita Group's share of investments - Investment KPI - in eligible and non-eligible assets, respectively, as a result of weighting the exposures against the accurate data. Investments potentially contributing to the environmental objectives of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, and therefore eligible on a Turnover and Capex basis are 11.2% and 5.7% of total assets.

Therefore, the share of investments not eligible for the Taxonomy, as a function of Turnover and Capex percentages, are equivalent to 88.8% and 94.3% respectively.

Furthermore, within the Group's insurance business, the Underwriting KPI, representative of non-life underwriting, was performed. In this regard, revenues related to the underwriting of fire and other property damage policies were identified, valued in relation to the activity '10.1 - Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils', in accordance with Annex II of the Climate Act. Therefore, following the alignment and eligibility analyses, as also reported in the section on turnover KPIs, it was only possible to identify the share of eligible business related to the underwriting of non-life insurance policies on climate-related perils, which is equivalent to 3.5% of the total revenue generated in the non-life insurance business; therefore, the share of non-eligible business represents 96.5%.

### Other KPIs

Lastly, with reference to the additional indicators required by the regulations for the categories of financial companies in which BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita fall, the results for the current year are set out below:

- z the "Share of exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers" of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita is 81.5% and 79.8% respectively;
- z the "Share of derivatives"127 of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita is equal to 1.9% and 1.8% respectively;
- z BancoPosta Fondi SGR's and Poste Vita's "Share of exposures in companies not subject to non-financial reporting requirements" is 39.6% and 48.2%, respectively.

<sup>127.</sup> In continuity with what was reported at 31.12.21, the absolute values of derivatives at mark-to-market for both BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita were also considered for this year

### Correlation table between the document "Towards common metrics and consistent reporting of sustainable value creation" of the world economic forum and the gri indicators present in the integrated report

September 2020 saw the publication of the updated version of the document "Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation", presented in January 2020 during the World Economic Forum in Davos, which defines a set of universal indicators for ESG performance applicable by all companies, regardless of business area, with the aim of making non-financial disclosures more easily comparable. The indicators are organised into four pillars: Governance, Planet, People and Prosperity.

### Correlation table between sasb indicators and indicators of the integrated report of Poste Italiane

GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) are the most internationally recognised standards for the definition of sustainability reporting strategies and systems. In view of the growing importance of SASB reporting for investors, the following table shows the correspondence with the indicators used in the 2022 Integrated Report

#### [H](#page-98-0)YBRID POLICY - MULTI-CLASS

In multi-class products, a part of the premium is invested in separate asset management schemes and determines the guaranteed capital share, while a part is invested in unit-linked funds, which are characterised by diversified asset allocations that aim to seize return opportunities by investing in funds linked to financial market trends.

#### [I](#page-217-0)NFLATION LINKED

These are government bonds that provide investors with protection against rising price levels: both the principal repaid at maturity and the coupons paid are, in fact, revalued on the basis of inflation.

#### [I](#page-92-0)NSURANCE CLASS

A class of insurance is defined as a category into which it is possible to classify policies pertaining to the same, or similar, type of risk. Two macro sections can be distinguished:

- Non-life insurance: covers policies that intervene to compensate the client in the event of material and physical damage, relating to personal property, assets, person;

Non-life contracts are divided into the following classes:

- 1. Accidents (including accidents at work and occupational diseases); lump sum benefits; temporary benefits; mixed forms; transported persons;
- 2. Sickness: lump sum benefits; temporary benefits; mixed forms;
- 3. Land vehicles (excluding rail vehicles): all damage suffered by: self-propelled land vehicles; non-self-propelled land vehicles;
- 4. Railway vehicle bodies: any damage suffered by railway vehicles;
- 5. Aircraft bodies: any damage suffered by aircraft;
- 6. Sea, lake and river vehicles: all damage suffered by: river vehicles; lake vehicles; sea vehicles;
- 7. Transported goods (including goods, luggage and any other property): any damage suffered by transported goods or luggage, regardless of the nature of the means of transport;

{484}------------------------------------------------

- 8. Fire and natural elements: any damage suffered by property (other than property included in classes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) caused by: fire; explosion; storm; natural elements other than storm; nuclear energy; land subsidence;
- 9. Other damage to property: any damage suffered by property (other than property included in classes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) caused by hail or frost, as well as any other event, such as theft, other than those included in class 8;
- 10. Land motor vehicle liability: any liability arising out of the use of land motor vehicles (including carrier's liability);
- 11. Aircraft liability: any liability arising out of the use of aircraft (including carrier's liability);
- 12. Sea, lake and river vehicle liability: all liability arising from the use of river, lake and sea vehicles (including carrier's liability);
- 13. General Liability: any liability other than those mentioned in No. 10, 11 and 12;
- 14. Credit: asset losses from defaults; export credit; hire purchase; mortgage credit; agricultural credit;
- 15. Bail: direct bail; indirect bail;
- 16. Pecuniary losses of various kinds: risks related to employment; insufficient income (general); bad weather; loss of profits; persistent overhead; unforeseen business expenses; loss of market value; loss of rents or income; indirect business losses other than those mentioned above; non-commercial pecuniary losses; other pecuniary losses;
- 17. Legal protection: legal protection;
- 18. Assistance: assistance to people in difficult situations.
- z Life class: this includes policies taken out in order to guarantee a lump sum to the chosen beneficiaries indicated in the insurance contract, upon the occurrence of the event that is the subject of the policy (e.g. the death of the insured in the case of a death policy).

Life insurance policies are further divided into six classes:

Class I - Life insurance;

Class II - Nuptial and birth insurance;

Class III - Insurance included in classes I and II, the main benefits of which are directly linked to the value of units in collective investment undertakings or internal funds or to indices or other reference values;

Class IV - Health insurance and insurance against the risk of non-self-sufficiency covered by long-term, non-cancellable contracts for the risk of severe disability due to illness or accident or longevity;

Class V - Capitalisation operations;

Class VI - Management operations of collective funds set up to provide benefits in the event of death, survival or cessation or reduction of employment.

#### [M](#page-99-0)2M (MACHINE-TO-MACHINE) SIM

M2M SIM make use of technology that enables the integration and dialogue between devices (even of different types) installed at any distance from each other through sensors that send (or acquire) data that are then transmitted to a central server via a network. They are exclusively dedicated to data traffic, the voice area is completely disabled and in its place is a module that allows both control and remote control.

#### MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONS

Fees paid to the manager by direct debit from the fund's assets to remunerate management activity in the strict sense. They are calculated daily on the fund's net assets and drawn at larger intervals (monthly, quarterly, etc.). They are generally expressed on an annual basis.

#### [M](#page-58-0)ERCHANT

#### MIFID (MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE)

Directive 2004/39/EC, in force since 1 November 2007, has the main objective of standardising the rules of financial market participants at European level in order to protect investors by imposing an obligation on intermediaries to act honestly, fairly and professionally in order to serve their clients' best interests. The regulation introduced a classification of clients on the basis of different degrees of financial experience: retail clients (retail), professional clients (professional clients), and eligible counterparties. The purpose of this subdivision is to adopt protection measures consistent with each category of investor, respecting the different protection needs arising from the information gathered about its knowledge and experience in investment matters, its financial situation and its investment objectives, in order to verify the suitability or appropriateness of the investment service or financial instrument requested and/or proposed. In addition, intermediaries are obliged to provide correct, clear and not misleading information by describing the financial services and instruments offered, providing information on losses incurred, fees and costs related to the services provided and the presence of possible conflicts of interest. Entered into force on 3 January 2018 (replacing the so-called MiFID I, from which it takes principles and aims), the MiFID II Directive aims to increase the efficiency and transparency of the markets by raising the level of investor protection, by means of measures aimed at informing clients of the essential characteristics of the activity provided, including in terms of the risks and costs of the proposed transactions, and by reinforcing certain organisational requirements and rules of conduct in the phase of designing and offering products to clients, as well as in terms of training of investment advisors.

#### [M](#page-55-0)UTUAL FUNDS

These are collective investment undertakings, managed by asset management companies (AMC), which pool the liquidity provided by their clients and invest it, as a single asset, in movable financial assets (shares, bonds, government securities, etc.) or, for some of them, in real estate assets, respecting rules aimed at reducing risk. Each investor becomes the owner of a number of units whose value varies over time and according to the performance of the securities purchased 

{485}------------------------------------------------

by the Management Company with the fund's assets. There are different types of funds, classified, for example, according to the type of financial instruments in which they invest (e.g. European equities or American bonds) or according to the type of profit-sharing of investors. Funds can be either 'closed' (with the subscription of units only during the offer period and the redemption of units taking place, as a rule, only at the Fund's maturity) or 'open' (with the subscription and redemption of units at any time).

Prepaid cards are issued by banks, electronic money institutions (IMEL) and the Italian Post Office. Reloadable prepaid cards have a maximum reloadable value that differs from issuer to issuer and can be reloaded several times. The prepaid card can also be equipped with an IBAN (International Bank Account Number), which allows the main operations of a current account to be carried out, by means of transfers or direct debits, such as, for example, crediting wages or pensions, and paying utility bills.

#### [S](#page-97-0)HADOW ACCOUNTING

Accounting Practice (IFRS 4), which allows for the mitigation of valuation asymmetries existing between financial assets included in segregated accounts valued according to IFRS 9 and mathematical reserves valued according to local accounting standards. Shadow accounting allows an insurer to change the accounting policies applied to insurance liabilities (i.e. its statutory technical provisions) so that a recognised but unrealised gain or loss on an asset affects the measurement of insurance liabilities in the same way that a realised gain or loss does.

Poste Italiane is one of the accredited Digital Identity managers.

#### [S](#page-83-0)TRONG CUSTOMER AUTHENTICATION (SCA)

SCA or Strong Customer Authentication requires that all electronic payment transactions, and some remote transactions that carry a risk of fraud, be confirmed and authorised by combining two or more authentication factors, chosen from something that only the person making the transaction possesses (an app on a mobile device or a key that generates OTP codes), or an element of inherence, i.e. something that uniquely distinguishes the user (a fingerprint, facial geometry, or another biometric feature).

#### [T](#page-223-0)RANSITIONAL MEASURES

The transitional measures on technical provisions (MTRT) were introduced by Directive 2014/51/EU (the so-called Omnibus II) to allow for a gradual transition from the previous prudential regime (so-called Solvency I) to the Solvency II regime, preventing the new requirements from having undesirable effects on companies and the market.

The rules provide that insurance companies, as of 1 January 2016 and until 31 December 2031, may, subject to authorisation by the Institute, apply a transitional deduction to the technical provisions calculated at the end of each financial year, determined as a share of the (positive) difference between the amount of technical provisions calculated in accordance with Solvency II on 1 January 2016 and those recorded in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 (Solvency I).

### 1. Introduction

Poste Italiane SpA (the "Parent Company") is the company formed following conversion of the former Public Administration entity, "Poste Italiane", under Resolution 244 of 18 December 1997. Its registered office is at Viale Europa 190, Rome (Italy).

Poste Italiane's shares have been listed on the Mercato Telematico Azionario (the MTA, an electronic stock exchange) since 27 October 2015. At 31 December 2022, the Company is 35% owned by CDP and 29.3% owned by the MEF, with the remaining shares held by institutional and retail investors. Poste Italiane SpA continues to be under the control of the MEF. At 31 December 2022, the Parent Company holds 7,535,991 treasury shares (equal to around 0.58% of the share capital).

The Poste Italiane Group (the "Group") provides a universal postal service in Italy as well as integrated communication, logistics, financial and insurance products and services throughout the country via its national network of approximately 13,000 post offices.

The Group's business is assessed and presented on the basis of four operating segments: (i) Mail, Parcels and Distribution, (ii) Payments and Mobile, (iii) Financial Services and (iv) Insurance Services.

In addition to the mail, parcel and logistics service, the Mail, Parcels and Distribution segment also includes the activities of the sales network, the Post Offices and the corporate functions of Poste Italiane SpA that provide services to the other segments in which the Group operates. The sector also includes the provision of Welfare services.

The Payments and Mobile Services segment includes the management of payments and e-money services, also carried out through the network of LIS points of sale, as well as mobile and fixed telephone services and energy (electricity and gas) sales services to end customers by PostePay SpA.

The Financial Services segment refers to the placement and distribution of financial and insurance products and services by Bancoposta, such as current accounts, postal savings products (on behalf of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti), mutual investment funds, loans provided by banks, policies and the activities of BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR.

The Insurance Services segment regards primarily the activities of Poste Vita SpA, which operates in ministerial life assurance Classes I, III and V, and of its direct subsidiary, Poste Assicura SpA, which operates in P&C insurance.

In addition, it should be noted that in the first half of 2022 the company Poste Welfare Servizi, previously allocated to the Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit, is represented in the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit. The comparative statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position figures have therefore been reclassified to reflect this organisational change.

This section of the Annual Report (*Poste Italiane's Financial Statements*) at 31 December 2022 includes the consolidated financial statements of the Poste Italiane Group, the separate financial statements of Poste Italiane SpA and BancoPosta RFC's Separate Report. The Report has been prepared in euros, the currency of the economy in which the Group operates.

The Group's consolidated financial statements consist of the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the notes to the financial statements. All amounts in the financial statements and the notes are shown in millions of euros and rounded (without decimal figures), unless stated otherwise. It follows that the sum of the rounded amounts may not coincide with the rounded totals.

The separate financial statements of Poste Italiane SpA consist of the statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes. Amounts in the financial statements are shown in euros (except for the statement of cash flows, which is shown in thousands of euros), whilst those in the notes are shown in millions of euros (without decimal figures), unless stated otherwise. It follows that the sum of the rounded amounts may not coincide with the rounded totals.

The consolidated and separate financial statements contain notes applicable to both sets of financial statements, providing information on matters common to both the Group and Poste Italiane SpA. The relevant matters specifically regard:

{494}------------------------------------------------

- z the basis of presentation used and accounting standards adopted;
- z disclosure of the sources and the procedures used in determining fair value;
- z financial risk disclosures;
- z a summary of the principal proceedings pending and relations with the authorities;
- z and, in general, certain additional disclosures required by accounting standards, whose presentation in a single section is designed to provide the reader with better information (e.g. the analysis of net debt, key performance indicators for investee companies, etc.).

BancoPosta RFC's Separate Report, which forms an integral part of Poste Italiane SpA's financial statements, prepared in accordance with the specific financial reporting rules laid down by the applicable banking regulations, is dealt with separately in this Section.

{495}------------------------------------------------

### 2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies

### 2.1 Compliance with IAS/IFRS

The annual accounts are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"), and endorsed by the European Union ("EU") in EC Regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, and in accordance with Legislative Decree 38 of 28 February 2005, which introduced regulations governing the adoption of IFRS in Italian law.

The term IFRS includes all the International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards ("IAS") and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC", previously known as the Standing Interpretations Committee or "SIC"), adopted by the European Union and contained in the EU Regulations in force at 31 December 2022, regarding which no derogations were made.

### 2.2 Basis of presentation

The accounting standards reflect the full operations of the Group and Poste Italiane SpA in the foreseeable future. The companies of the Poste Italiane Group, as a going concern, prepare their financial statements on a going concern basis, also taking into account the Group's economic and financial outlook derived from the Strategic Plan approved on 18 March 2021 (and the related updates approved by the Board of Directors on 22 March 2022) and the 2023 Budget approved by the Board of Directors on 29 March 2023.

The statement of financial position has been prepared on the basis of the "current/non-current distinction"128. In the Statement of profit (loss) for the year, the classification criterion based on the nature of the cost components has been adopted; details of interest income calculated using the effective interest criterion, as well as gains and losses deriving from the derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost (as per IAS 1 - *Presentation of Financial Statements* paragraph 82) are provided in section 4.3 Notes to the Statement of profit or loss. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under the indirect method129.

The accounting standards and the recognition, measurement and classification criteria adopted in these annual accounts are the same as those used in the previous year's preparation, with the exception of what is stated in Section 2.5 - *New accounting standards and interpretations*.

The disclosures provided in these annual financial statements take into account the guidelines and recommendations of the European regulatory and supervisory bodies (ESMA)130 published during the year in order to provide a guideline in the current economic context, which is heavily influenced by the Russia/Ukraine conflict. The accounting implications of complying with these recommendations are described in section 2.4 - *Use of estimates*.

In preparing the annual accounts, the CONSOB regulations contained in Resolution 15519 of 27 July 2006 and in Ruling DEM/6064293 of 28 July 2006 have been taken into account.

<sup>128.</sup> Current assets include assets (such as inventories and trade receivables) that are sold, consumed or realised as part of the normal operating cycle even when they are not expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period (IAS 1, par. 68).

<sup>129.</sup> Under the indirect method, net cash from operating activities is determined by adjusting profit/(loss) for the year to reflect the impact of non-cash items, any deferment or provisions for previous or future operating inflows or outflows, and revenue or cost items linked to cash flows from investing or financing activities.

<sup>130.</sup> Public statement ESMA32-63-1320 of 28 October 2022 "European common enforcement priorities for 2022 annual financial reports".

{496}------------------------------------------------

In accordance with CONSOB Resolution 15519 of 27 July 2006, the statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss and the statement of cash flows show amounts deriving from related party transactions. The statement of profit or loss also shows, where applicable and of significant amount, income and expenses deriving from non-recurring transactions, or transactions that occur infrequently in the normal course of business. Detailed information about non-recurring events and transactions, including their impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the company and/or the group, is provided in the section "*Material non-recurring events and/or transactions*".

The values shown in the financial statements are compared with the corresponding values for the same period of the previous year. In this regard, it should be noted that certain data referring to the year under comparison have also been reclassified to take into account the new representation of Poste Welfare Servizi within the Mail, Parcels and Distribution segment.

Pursuant to article 2447-*septies* of the Italian Civil Code, following the creation of BancoPosta's ring-fenced capital in 2011, the assets and contractual rights included therein (hereafter: "BancoPosta RFC") are shown separately in Poste Italiane SpA's statement of financial position, in a specific supplementary statement, and in the notes to the financial statements.

With regard to the interpretation and application of newly published, or revised, international accounting standards, and to certain aspects of taxation131, where the related interpretations are based on examples of best practice or case-law that cannot yet be regarded as exhaustive, the financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the relevant best practices and the guidelines agreed with the Tax Authorities as part of "cooperative compliance". Any future guidance or updated interpretations will be reflected in subsequent reporting periods, in accordance with the specific procedures provided for by the related standards.

Finally, Directive 2004/109/EC (the 'Transparency Directive') and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 introduced the obligation for issuers of securities listed on regulated markets in the European Union to prepare their annual financial report in a single electronic reporting format (European Single Electronic Format), approved by ESMA. Therefore, it is envisaged that the Annual Financial Report be prepared in XHTML format and that, for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2022, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in addition to the Notes to the Financial Statements, be prepared using the ESMA-IFRS taxonomy and the integrated computer language (iXBRL).

### 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies and measurement criteria

The Poste Italiane Group's financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain items for which fair value measurement is obligatory.

The accounting policies adopted by the Poste Italiane Group are described below.

### Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at acquisition or construction cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Where the condition is met, this cost is increased for charges directly related to the purchase or construction of the asset, including – where identifiable and measurable – that relating to employees involved in the planning and/or preparation for use phase. Interest expense incurred by the Group for loans specifically for the acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment is capitalised together with the value of the asset; all other interest expense is recognised as finance costs in profit or loss for the year in question. Costs incurred for routine and/or cyclical maintenance and repairs are recognised directly in profit or loss in the related year. The capitalisation of costs attributable to the extension, modernisation or improvement of assets owned by Group companies or held under lease is carried out to the extent that they qualify for separate recognition as an asset or as a component of an asset, applying the component approach, which requires each component with a different estimated useful life and value to

<sup>131.</sup> The tax authorities have issued regular official interpretations only in respect of certain of the tax-related effects of the measures contained in Legislative Decree 38 of 28 February 2005, Law 244 of 24 December 2007 (the 2008 Budget Law) and the Ministerial Decree of 1 April 2009, implementing the 2008 Budget Law, which introduced numerous changes to IRES and IRAP. The MEF Decree issued on 8 June 2011 contains instructions regarding the coordinated application of EU-endorsed international accounting standards coming into effect between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010, in addition to regulations governing determination of the tax bases for IRES and IRAP. In addition, the new standards are subject to the rules contained in the endorsement tax decrees issued by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, in application of the provisions of Law no. 10 of 26 February 2011 (Decreto Milleproroghe).

{497}------------------------------------------------

be recognised and amortised separately.

The original cost is depreciated on a straight-line basis from the date the asset is available and ready for use, based on the asset's expected useful life. Land is not depreciated. For details of the useful life of the main classes of property, plant and equipment of the Group, reference should be made to Note 2.4 - *Use of estimates*.

Property and any related fixed plant and machinery located on land held under concession or sub-concession, which is to be returned free of charge to the grantor at the end of the concession term, are accounted for, based on the nature of the asset, within property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the residual concession term.

At each reporting date, property, plant and equipment is analysed in order to identify the existence of any indicators of impairment (in accordance with IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets; please refer to the treatment of impairment of assets).

Gains and losses deriving from the disposal or retirement of an asset are calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount of the asset retired or sold, and are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the transaction occurs.

### Investment property

Investment property relates to land or buildings held with a view to earn rental or lease income or for capital appreciation or both; in both cases such property generates cash flows that are largely independent of other assets. The same accounting treatment is applied to investment property as to property, plant and equipment. For details on the useful life of the Group's investment property, please refer to Note 2.4 - *Use of estimates*.

### Intangible assets

An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, which is controllable and capable of generating future economic benefits. The initial carrying amount is adjusted for accumulated amortisation, where an amortisation process is envisaged, and for any impairment losses.

In particular, Industrial patents, intellectual property rights, licences and similar rights are initially valued at purchase cost. This cost is increased for charges directly related to the purchase or preparation for use of the asset. Interest expense that the Group may incur for loans specifically for the purchase of industrial patents, intellectual property rights, licenses and similar rights are capitalised together with the value of the asset; all other interest expense is recognised as finance costs in profit or loss for the year. Amortisation starts once the asset is available for use. Amortisation is applied on a straight-line basis, in order to distribute the purchase cost over the shorter of the expected useful life of the asset and any related contract terms, from the date the entity has the right to use the asset.

Industrial patents, intellectual property rights, licenses and similar rights include costs directly associated with the internal production of unique and identifiable software products that will generate future economic benefits with a time horizon of more than one year. Direct costs include - where identifiable and measurable - the charge related to employees involved in software development. Costs incurred for the maintenance of internally developed software products are charged to profit or loss for the year in question. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and extends, systematically and on a straight-line basis, over its estimated useful life. Any research costs are not capitalised.

Among the Group's intangible assets, Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the company or business acquired, at the date of acquisition. Goodwill attributable to investments accounted for using the equity method is included in the carrying amount of the equity investment. Goodwill is not amortised on a systematic basis, but is tested periodically for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. This test is performed with reference to the cash generating unit ("CGU") to which the goodwill is attributable. The method applied in conducting impairment tests and the impact on the accounts of any impairment losses are described in the paragraph, "Impairment of assets".

{498}------------------------------------------------

### Lease arrangements

At the conclusion of the contract, the actual existence of a lease component is assessed. The contract is, or contains, a lease if in return for consideration it confers the right to control the use of a specified asset for a period of time. The activity is usually specified as explicitly stated in the contract or when it is available for use by the customer. The right of control is evaluated on the basis of the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits deriving from the use of the asset and the right to decide on its use. The initial assessment is only reviewed during the term of the contract if there are modifications to the contract conditions with substantial impact on the right to control the underlying asset.

If the lease contract also contains a non-lease component, the latter is separated and treated in accordance with the relevant accounting standard. However, if separation cannot be achieved on the basis of objective criteria, the lease and non-lease component are submitted jointly to the accounting rules of the lease.

On the contract commencement date, a right to use the leased asset is recorded, equal to the initial value of the corresponding lease liability, plus payments due before or at the same time as the contract commencement date (e.g. agency fees). Subsequently, said right of use is measured less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation starts on the commencement date of the lease and extends over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset.

The lease liability is initially recorded at the present value of the lease instalments not paid on the date the contract commences132, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate, defined by loan period and for each Group company. The lease liability is subsequently reduced to reflect the lease payments made and increased to reflect interest on the remaining amount.

The lease liability is restated (resulting in a right-of-use adjustment) in the event of a change in:

- z the lease term (for example, in the case of early termination of the contract or an extension of the lease);
- z the assessment of a purchase option for the underlying asset; in these cases, lease payments due are reviewed on the basis of the revised lease term and to take account of the change in the amounts payable in view of the purchase option;
- z future lease payments deriving from a change in the index or rate used to determine the payments (e.g. ISTAT), or as a result of a renegotiation of the financial conditions.

Only in the case of a significant change in the lease term or in future lease payments, the remaining lease liability is remeasured with reference to the incremental borrowing rate at the date of the modification; in all other cases, the lease liability is remeasured using the initial discount rate.

If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the right of use cannot be recovered, this asset is tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36 - *Impairment of Assets*.

The Group avails itself of the option granted by the principle of non-application of the provisions provided in the standard to short-term contracts (with a duration of no more than twelve months) and to contracts in which the individual underlying asset is of low value (up to €5,000); for these contracts, lease payments are recognised in profit or loss as matching entry to short-term trade payables.

### Impairment of assets

At the end of each reporting period, property, plant, equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are analysed to assess whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired (as defined by IAS 36). If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the impairment loss to be recognised in profit or loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use, represented by the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. In calculating value in use, future cash flow estimates are discounted using a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, the period of the investment and the risks specific to the asset. The realisable value of assets that do not generate separate cash flows is determined with reference to the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

<sup>132.</sup> The payments included in the initial measurement of the lease liability include:

<sup>•</sup> fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;

<sup>•</sup> variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (e.g. ISTAT indexes);

<sup>•</sup> the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are, in contrast, not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability. These payments are recognised as a cost in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the event or the condition giving rise to the obligation occurs.

{499}------------------------------------------------

Regardless of any impairment indicator, the assets listed below are tested for impairment every year:

- z intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or that are not yet available; the impairment test can take place at any time during the year, provided that it is performed at the same time in each of the following years;
- z goodwill acquired in a business combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the amount by which the net carrying amount of the asset, or the CGU to which it belongs, exceeds its recoverable amount. In particular, if the impairment loss regards goodwill and is higher than the related carrying amount, the remaining amount is allocated to the assets included in the CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated, in proportion to their carrying amount133. Except in the case of goodwill, if the impairment indicators no longer exist, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reinstated and the reversal recognised in profit or loss. The reversal must not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised and depreciation or amortisation been charged.

### Investments

In the Poste Italiane Group's consolidated financial statements, investments in subsidiaries that are not significant (individually or in the aggregate) and are not consolidated, and those in companies over which the Group exerts significant influence ("associates") and in joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method. See note 2.6 – *Basis of consolidation*.

In Poste Italiane SpA's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for at cost (including any directly attributable incidental expenses), after adjustment for any impairments. Investments in subsidiaries and associates are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any impairment losses (or subsequent reversals of impairment losses) are recognised in the same way and to the same extent described with regard to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the paragraph, "Impairment of assets".

### Financial instruments

In accordance with IFRS 9 - *Financial instruments*, the classification of financial assets and liabilities is determined at the time of initial recognition and at the relative fair value, according to the purpose for which they were acquired. The purchase and sale of financial instruments is recognised by category, either on the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset (the transaction date), or, in the case of insurance transactions and BancoPosta's operations, at the settlement date134. Any changes in fair value between the transaction date and the settlement date are recognised in the financial statements.

On the other hand, trade receivables are recognised at their transaction price, in accordance with IFRS 15 - *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*.

On initial recognition, financial assets are classified in one of the following categories, based on the business model adopted to manage them and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows:

- z Financial assets measured at amortised cost
This category reflects financial assets held to collect the contractual cash flows (the held to collect or HTC business model) representing solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). These assets are measured at amortised cost, that is the value assigned to the financial asset or liability on initial recognition, net of any principal reimbursement, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation by using the effective interest rate method on the difference between the initial value and the value at maturity, after deducting any impairment. The business model on which the classification of financial assets is based permits the sale of such assets; if the sales are not occasional, and are not immaterial in terms of value, consistency with the HTC business model should be assessed.

z Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

This category includes financial assets held both to collect the relevant contractual cash flows and for sale (the held to collect and sell or HTC&S business model), with the contractual cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest. These financial assets are measured at fair value and, until they are derecognised or reclassified, gains or losses from valuation are recognised in other comprehensive income. Exceptions to this are gains and losses due to impairment and foreign

<sup>133.</sup> If the amount of the impairment loss is greater than the carrying amount of the asset or CGU, in accordance with IAS 36, no liability is recognised, unless recognition of a liability is required by an international accounting standard other than IAS 36.

<sup>134.</sup> This is possible for transactions carried out on organised markets (the "regular way").

{500}------------------------------------------------

exchange gains and losses recognised in the profit or loss in the year in question. If the financial asset is derecognised, the accumulated gains/(losses) recognised in OCI are recycled to profit or loss.

This category also includes equity instruments that would otherwise be recognised through profit or loss, for which the irrevocable election was made to recognise changes in fair value through OCI (the FVTOCI option). This option entails the recognition of solely dividends through profit or loss.

- z Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
This category includes: (a) financial assets primarily held for trading; (b) those that qualify for designation at fair value through profit or loss, exercising the fair value option; (c) financial assets that must be recognised at fair value through profit or loss; (d) derivative instruments, with the exception of the effective portion of those designated as cash flow hedges. Financial assets belonging to the category in question are measured at fair value and the related changes are recognised in profit or loss. Derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss are recognised as assets or liabilities depending on whether the fair value is positive or negative; positive and negative fair values deriving from transactions with the same counterparty are offset during the collateralisation phase, where contractually provided for.

The classification as "current" or "non-current" of financial assets measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income depends on the contractual maturity of the instrument, since current assets are those whose realisation is expected within twelve months of the reporting date. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are, on the other hand, classified as "current" if held for trading and are expected to be sold within twelve months of the reporting date.

An expected credit loss (ECL) provision must be made for financial assets recognised at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value through OCI, as follows: (i) specific provisions for doubtful debts are made for expected losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost; (ii) expected losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss, with a contra entry in the fair value reserve in equity. The method utilised is the "General impairment model", whereby:

- z if on the reporting date the credit risk of a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a 12-month ECL is recognised (stage 1). Interest on the instrument is calculated on the gross carrying amount (amortised cost inclusive of the ECL);
- z if on the reporting date the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, a lifetime ECL is recognised (stage 2). Interest on the instrument is calculated on the gross carrying amount (amortised cost inclusive of the ECL);
- z if a financial instrument is already impaired on initial recognition or shows objective evidence of impairment as at the reporting date, lifetime expected losses are recognised. Interest is recognised at amortised cost (stage 3), i.e. on the basis of the exposure value - determined using the effective interest rate - adjusted for expected losses.

In determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, it is necessary to compare the risk of default of the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of default of the financial instrument on initial recognition. However, there is a rebuttable default presumption if the financial instrument is more than 90 days past due, unless there is reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a default criterion with greater lag is more appropriate. Regarding trade receivables, a simplified approach is applied to measure the expected credit loss, if these receivables do not contain a significant financing component pursuant to IFRS 15. The simplified approach is based on a matrix of observed historical losses.

In the extremely rare event of the entity deciding to change its business model, previously recognised financial assets are reclassified to the new accounting category; the effects of the reclassification are recognised only prospectively, and therefore, the previously recognised gains/losses and interest must not be restated. The effects of the reclassification are as follows:

- z if the financial asset is reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through profit or loss, the fair value of the asset is determined on the reclassification date. Gains and losses resulting from the difference between the previous amortised cost and fair value are recognised through profit or loss;
- z if the financial asset is reclassified from fair value through profit or loss to amortised cost, the fair value on the reclassification date becomes the new gross carrying amount;
- z if the financial asset is reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through other comprehensive income, the fair value of the asset is determined on the reclassification date. Gains and losses resulting from the difference between the previous amortised cost and fair value are recognised through other comprehensive income. The effective interest rate and the expected credit loss are not adjusted following reclassification;
- z if the financial asset is reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income to amortised cost, the cumulative gain (loss) recognised previously through other comprehensive income is derecognised from equity through an adjustment to the fair value of the financial asset on the reclassification date. Consequently, the financial asset is reported as though it had always been reported at amortised cost, by not changing the effective interest rate and the expected credit loss;

{501}------------------------------------------------

- z if the financial asset is reclassified from fair value through profit or loss to fair value through other comprehensive income, the financial asset continues to be measured at fair value;
- z if the financial asset is reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income to fair value through profit or loss, the financial asset continues to be measured at fair value. The cumulative gain (loss) recognised previously through other comprehensive income is recycled to profit or loss on the reclassification date.

Financial assets are derecognised when there is no longer a contractual right to receive cash flows from the investment or when all the related risks and rewards and control have been substantially transferred. If the substantial transfer of risks and rewards cannot be ascertained, financial assets are derecognised if no control is retained over them. Finally, transferred assets are derecognised if the contractual right to receive the cash flows of the assets is retained, but at the same time a contractual obligation is assumed to pay these flows to a third party, without delay and only to the extent of those received.

In addition, for impaired financial assets, derecognition may take place following the write-off of the same, following the acknowledgement that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery (e.g. prescription).

Financial liabilities, including loans, trade payables and other payment obligations, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. If there is a change in the expected cash flows and they can be reliably estimated, the value of borrowings is recalculated to reflect the change on the basis of the present value of estimated future cash flows and the internal rate of return initially applied. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities, unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the reporting period.

When required by the applicable IFRS (e.g. in the case of derivative liabilities), or when the irrevocable fair value option is exercised, financial liabilities are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In this case, changes in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised directly in equity, unless this treatment creates or enhances an accounting asymmetry, whereby the residual amount of the changes in the fair value of liabilities is recognised through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished or when the obligation specified in the contract expires, is cancelled or discharged.

For hedge accounting transactions, the Poste Italiane Group has elected to use the option made available by IFRS 9 and has retained the accounting treatments provided for by IAS 39. In accordance with this standard, derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is executed and if they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are accounted for in profit or loss for the period.

If, on the other hand, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value after initial recognition are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 – *Financial Instruments*: Recognition and Measurement, as described below.

The relationship between each hedging instrument and the hedged item is documented, as well as the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and the methods used to assess effectiveness. Assessment of whether the hedging derivative is effective takes place both at designation of each derivative instrument as hedging instrument, and during its life.

- z Fair value hedges135
When the hedge is related to recognised assets or liabilities, or an unrecognised firm commitment, the changes in fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognised in profit or loss. When the hedging transaction is not fully effective, resulting in differences between the above changes, the ineffective portion represents a loss or gain recognised separately in profit or loss for the period.

IAS 39 allows, in addition to individual financial assets and liabilities, the designation of a cash amount, representing a group of financial assets and liabilities (or portions thereof) as the hedged item in such a way that a group of derivative instruments may be used to reduce exposure to fair value interest rate risk (a so-called macro hedge). Macro hedges cannot be used for net amounts deriving from differences between assets and liabilities. Like micro hedges, macro hedges are deemed highly effective if, at their inception and throughout the term of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the cash amount are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedges, and if the effective results fall within the interval required by IAS 39.

<sup>135.</sup> A hedge of the exposure to a change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or of an unrecognised firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, and that could have an impact on profit or loss.

{502}------------------------------------------------

- z Cash flow hedges136
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges after initial recognition is recognised in a specific equity reserve, with movements in the reserve accounted for in "*Other comprehensive income*" (the "Cash flow hedge reserve"). A hedging transaction is generally considered highly effective if, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, changes in the expected future cash flows of the hedged item are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging transaction is not fully effective, the gain or loss arising from a change in fair value relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss for the period.

Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. In particular, in the case of hedges associated with a highly probable forecast transaction (such as the purchase of fixed income debt securities), the reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the period or in the periods in which the asset or liability, subsequently accounted for and connected to the aforementioned transaction, will affect profit or loss (for example, an adjustment to the return on the security).

If, during the life of the derivative, the forecast hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the related gains and losses accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss for the period. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the related gains and losses accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that time remain in equity and are recognised in profit or loss at the same time as the original underlying.

### Embedded derivatives

An embedded derivative is a derivative included in a combined contract or hybrid instrument, also containing a non-derivative contract or host contract, which originates all or part of the cash flows of the combined contract. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and recognised as a derivative when:

- z the host contract is not a financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss;
- z the economic risks and characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract;
- z a separate contract with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative.

Within the Group, contracts that may contain embedded derivatives are contracts for the purchase of non-financial items entered into by PostePay SpA with clauses or options that influence the contract price, for which, however, embedded derivatives are not separable from the host contract.

### Repurchase agreements

Any securities received as part of a transaction entailing subsequent re-sale and the delivery of securities as part of a transaction entailing their subsequent repurchase are not either recognised or derecognised in these financial statements. Consequently, in the case of securities purchased under a resale agreement, the amount paid is recognised as an amount due from customers or banks under Financial assets measured at amortised cost; in the case of securities sold under a repurchase agreement, the liability is recognised as an amount due to banks or customers under Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. The transactions described are subject to offsetting if, and only if, they are carried out with the same counterparty, have the same maturity and offsetting is provided for in the contract.

### Tax credits Law no. 77/2020

In order to identify the correct accounting treatment of receivables acquired in relation to Relaunch Decree no. 34/2020 (later converted into Law no. 77 of 17 July 2020), since it is not possible to identify the framework directly applicable to this case, in compliance with the provisions of IAS 8, an accounting policy was defined suitable for providing relevant and reliable information aimed at ensuring a faithful representation of the financial position, income and cash flows and which reflects the economic substance and not merely the form of the transaction. On the basis of the analyses carried out and the documents

<sup>136.</sup> A hedge of the exposure to the variability of cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with an asset or liability or with a highly probable forecast transaction, and that could have an impact on profit or loss.

{503}------------------------------------------------

published by the main Italian supervisory bodies (Joint Document of the Bank of Italy, IVASS and CONSOB137), although the definition of financial assets in IAS 32 is not directly applicable to this case, an accounting model was developed based on IFRS 9 given that:

- z at inception, an asset as defined by the Conceptual Framework arises in the transferee's financial statements;
- z they may be used to offset a payable that is usually settled in cash (tax payables), and exchanged for other financial assets on terms that may be potentially favourable to the entity;
- z a business model can be identified (Hold to Collect, Hold to Collect and Sell or other business models).

At the date of purchase, these receivables are recorded at their fair value (coinciding with the price paid) and subsequently measured:

- z at amortised cost, if acquired for use in offsetting tax or social security payables by Poste Italiane SpA, based on the provisions of the relevant regulations ("Hold to Collect" business model);
- z at fair value with impact on overall profitability, if also purchased for eventual sale to third parties ("Hold to Collect and Sell" business model).

It should be noted that during the year, tax credits previously measured at fair value through other comprehensive income were reclassified to the category tax credits at amortised cost. The reclassification, effective as of 1 October 2022, became necessary as a result of the lack of development in the market for second sales between financial intermediaries, which therefore required BancoPosta RFC to revise its business model for these loans.

### Classification of receivables and payables attributable to BancoPosta RFC

Receivables and payables attributable to BancoPosta RFC are treated as financial assets and liabilities if related to BancoPosta's typical deposit-taking and lending activities, or services provided under authority from customers. The related operating expenses and income, if not settled or classifiable in accordance with Bank of Italy Circular 272 of 30 July 2008 – The Account Matrix, are accounted for in trade receivables and payables.

### Own use exemption

The standards establishing the principles for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments are also applied to derivative contracts to buy or sell non-financial items that are settled net in cash or in another financial instrument, with the exception of contracts entered into, and that continue to be held, for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (the own use exemption). This exemption applies to the recognition and measurement of forward electricity and natural gas contracts entered into by the subsidiary Postepay SpA if the following conditions have been met:

- z the contract involves the physical supply of a commodity;
- z the entity has not entered into an offsetting contract;
- z the transaction must be entered into in accordance with expected purchase and/or sale or usage requirements.

When the above conditions are met, the contract for the purchase or sale of non-financial items is classified as a "normal contract of sale".

<sup>137.</sup> On 5 January 2021, the Bank of Italy, CONSOB and IVASS published Document no. 9 of the Coordination Round-Table Group on the Application of IAS/IFRS "Accounting Treatment of Tax Credits Associated with the "Heal Italy" and "Relaunch" Law Decrees Acquired as a Result of Disposal by Direct Beneficiaries or Previous Purchasers".

{504}------------------------------------------------

### Taxes

Current income tax expense is based on the best estimate of taxable profit for the period and the related regulations, applying the rates in force. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax assets are realised or the deferred tax liabilities are settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences derive from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group or it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on goodwill deriving from a business combination.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of taxes charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax effect is recognised directly in equity. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they are applied by the same tax authority to the same taxpaying entity, which has the legally exercisable right to offset the amounts recognised, and the entity has the intention of exercising this right. As a result, tax liabilities accruing in interim periods that are shorter than the tax year are not offset against related assets deriving from withholding tax or advances paid.

The Group's taxation and accounting standards take account of the effects of Poste Italiane SpA's participation in the national tax consolidation scheme, for which the option has been exercised in accordance with the law, together with the following subsidiaries: Poste Vita SpA, SDA Express Courier SpA, Poste Air Cargo Srl, Postel SpA, Europa Gestioni Immobiliari SpA, Poste Welfare Servizi Srl, Poste Assicura SpA, BancoPostaFondi SpA SGR, PostePay SpA, Poste Insurance Broker Srl, MLK Deliveries SpA, Indabox Srl and Nexive Network Srl. The tax consolidation arrangement is governed by Group regulations based on the principles of neutrality and equality of treatment, which are intended to ensure that the companies included in the tax consolidation are in no way penalised as a result. Following adoption of the tax consolidation arrangement, the Parent Company's tax expense is determined at consolidated level on the basis of the tax expense or tax losses for the period for each company included in the consolidation, taking account of any withholding tax or advances paid. Poste Italiane SpA posts its IRES tax expense to income taxes for the period, after adjustments to take account of the positive or negative impact of tax consolidation adjustments. Should the reductions or increases in tax expense deriving from such adjustments be attributable to the companies included in the tax consolidation, Poste Italiane SpA attributes such reductions or increases in tax expense to the companies in question. The economic benefits deriving from the offset of tax losses transferred to the consolidating entity by the companies participating in the tax consolidation arrangement are recognised in full by Poste Italiane SpA. Other taxes not related to income are included in "Other operating costs".

### Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of interchangeable items and goods for resale is calculated using the weighted average cost method. In the case of non-interchangeable items, cost is measured on the basis of the specific cost of the item at the time of purchase. The value of the inventories is adjusted, if necessary, by provisions for obsolete or slow-moving stock. When the circumstances that previously led to recognition of the above provisions no longer exist, or when there is a clear indication of an increase in the net realisable value, the provisions are fully or partly reversed, so that the new carrying amount is the lower of cost and net realisable value at the end of the reporting period. Assets are not, however, recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has incurred an expense that, based on the best information available at the date of preparation of the financial statements, is deemed unlikely to generate economic benefits for the Group after the end of the reporting period.

In the case of properties held for sale138, if present, cost is represented by the fair value of each asset at the date of acquisition, plus any directly attributable transaction costs, whilst the net realisable value is based on the estimated sale price under normal market conditions, less direct costs to sell.

Long-term contract work is measured using the percentage of completion method, using cost to cost accounting139.

Environmental certificates not used in the reporting period are recognised in inventories.

<sup>138.</sup> These are properties held by EGI SpA and not accounted for in "Investment property" as they were purchased for sale or subsequently reclassified as held for sale. 139. This method is based on the ratio of costs incurred as of a given date divided by the estimated total project cost. The resulting percentage is then applied to estimated total revenue, obtaining the value to be attributed to the contract work completed and accrued revenue at the given date.

{505}------------------------------------------------

### Environmental certificates

Within the Poste Italiane Group, environmental certificates refer to:

- z Emission allowances held by the company Poste Air Cargo Srl as an incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions140 with the aim of achieving an improvement in technologies used in energy production and industrial processes;
- z Guarantees of origin and carbon credits held by the company Postepay SpA; the former aimed at certifying the origin from renewable sources of the electricity sold; the latter aimed at fully offsetting CO2 emissions from natural gas consumption.

### Emission allowances

The European Emissions Trading System, which works on the basis of the cap and trade principle, has capped annual greenhouse gas emissions at European level. This corresponds to the issue, free of charge, of a set number of emission allowances by the competent national authorities. During the year, depending on the effective volume of greenhouse gas emissions produced with respect to the above cap, each company has the option of selling or purchasing emission allowances on the market.

The issue, free of charge, of emission allowances involves a commitment to produce, in the relevant year, a quantity of greenhouse gas emissions in proportion to the emission allowances received: this commitment, commensurate with the market value of the emission allowances at the time of allocation, is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. At the end of the year, the commitment is reduced or derecognised in proportion to the greenhouse gas emissions effectively produced and any residual value is reported in the section, "Additional information", in the Annual Report.

### Guarantees of origin and carbon credits

Guarantees of Origin are certifications attesting to the renewable origin of the sources used by IGO (Guarantee of Origin Plants) classified plants. For each MWh of renewable electricity fed into the grid by IGO-qualified plants, the GSE (Gestore Servizi Energetici) issues a GO certificate to the producer, in accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC. As of 1 January 2013, electricity sales companies are obliged to procure a quantity of GO certificates equal to the electricity sold as renewable. To do this, each company is required, by 31 March of the year following the year in which electricity was supplied to end customers, to cancel a quantity of GOs equal to the electricity sold as renewable.

Carbon credits, on the other hand, represent a negotiable security that allows a company or organisation to offset the carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emitted in the course of its activities (in the case of Postepay SpA, the CO2 emissions of the gas marketed to end customers), by adhering to environmental sustainability projects aimed at pursuing a path of ecological transition and de-carbonisation.

CO2 offsetting takes place through the acquisition of carbon credits for a value equivalent to the CO2 emissions resulting from the gas consumption of the Company's end customers. Each carbon credit represents the offsetting of one tonne of CO2 .

The accounting treatment of emission allowances, as well as guarantees of origin and carbon credits to the extent that they are similar, is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the OIC "*Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances*", as well as with the reference best practice for the main IAS adopters.

The purchase and sales of environmental certificates are accounted for in profit or loss in the year in which the transaction occurs. At the end of the year, any surplus deriving from purchases are accounted for in closing inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value141. In the event of a deficit, the resulting charge and related liability are accounted for at the end of the year at market value.

### Business Combinations

Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is equal to the sum of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and any interest issued by the acquirer. Costs directly attributable to the transaction are recognised in the Statement of profit or loss.

<sup>140.</sup> Introduced into the Italian and European regulatory system by the Kyoto Protocol.

<sup>141.</sup> Any surplus emission allowances allocated free of charge are not accounted for in closing inventory.

{506}------------------------------------------------

The amount transferred is allocated by recognising the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree at the related fair values at the acquisition date.

Any positive difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its recoverable value is recognised as goodwill and recorded under intangible assets:

- z the sum of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date, the amount of any non-controlling interest, and, in the case of business combinations achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and
- z the net value of the amounts, at the acquisition date, of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are identifiable in the acquiree measured at fair value.

In the event of a negative difference, this surplus represents the profit from a purchase on favourable terms and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

If at the time of preparing the financial statements the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities arising from the transaction can only be determined provisionally, the business combination is recognised using these provisional values. Any adjustments resulting from the completion of the valuation process are recognised retrospectively within twelve months of the acquisition date.

In the case of a business combination achieved in stages, the interests previously held in the acquiree are remeasured at fair value at the new acquisition date and any difference (positive or negative) is recognised in the statement of profit or loss or in the statement of comprehensive income if appropriate.

### Cash and deposits attributable to BancoPosta

Cash and securities held at post offices, and bank deposits attributable to the operations of BancoPosta RFC, are accounted for separately from cash and cash equivalents as they derive from deposits subject to investment restrictions, or from advances from the Italian Treasury to ensure that post offices can operate. This cash may only be used in settlement of these obligations.

### Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents refer to cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, amounts that at 31 December 2022 the Parent Company has temporarily deposited with the MEF and other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. Current account overdrafts are accounted for in current liabilities.

### Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale and discontinued operations

In compliance with IFRS 5, non-current assets, disposal groups and discontinued operations are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value, less costs to sell.

When it is highly probable that the carrying amount of a non-current asset, or a disposal group, will be recovered, in its present condition, principally through a sale transaction or other form of disposal, rather than through continuing use, and the transaction is likely to take place in the short term, the asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale or as a discontinuing operation in the statement of financial position. The transaction is deemed to be highly probable, when the Parent Company's Board of Directors, or, when so authorised, the board of directors of a subsidiary, has committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated. Sale transactions include exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange has commercial substance.

Non-current assets and net assets in a disposal group held for sale are recognised as discontinued operations if one of the following conditions is met: i) they represent a major line of business or geographical area of operation, ii) they are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, or, iii) they are subsidiaries acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The profit or loss from discontinued operations, and any gains or losses following the sale, are presented separately in a specific item in profit or loss, after the related taxation. The economic values of discontinued operations are also shown for the years under comparison.

{507}------------------------------------------------

If the commitment to a plan to sell is assumed after the end of the reporting period, and/or the asset or disposal group can only be included in the transaction under conditions that are different from the current conditions, the Group does not proceed with reclassification and discloses the necessary information.

If, after the date of preparation of the financial statements, an asset (or disposal group) no longer meets the conditions for classification as held for sale, it must be reclassified following measurement at the lower of:

- z the carrying amount before the asset (or disposal group) was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation, impairments or reversals of impairments that would have been recognised if the asset (or disposal group) had not been classified as held for sale;
- z the recoverable amount, calculated at the date on which the decision not to sell was made.

Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a non-current asset that ceases to be classified as held for sale is included in "Profit/ (Loss) for the year from continuing operations" in the period in which it no longer meets the conditions for classification as held for sale. If an individual asset or liability is removed from the disposal group classified as held for sale, the remaining assets and liabilities in the disposal group continue to be measured as a single group only if they continue to meet the conditions for classification as held for sale.

### Equity

### Share capital

Share capital is represented by Poste Italiane SpA's subscribed and paid-up capital. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recognised as a reduction of the share capital, net of any deferred tax effect.

### Treasury shares

Treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. The effects of any subsequent sales are recognised in equity.

### Hybrid bonds

Perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds are classified as an equity instrument in the financial statements, in view of the fact that the issuing Company has the unconditional right to defer repayment of the principal and payment of the coupons until the date of its winding-up or liquidation. Therefore, the amount received from the subscribers of these instruments, net of the related issue costs, is recognised as an increase in Group shareholders' equity; conversely, repayments of principal and payments of coupons due (at the time the related contractual obligation arises) are recognised as a decrease in equity.

### Reserves

Reserves include capital and revenue reserves. They include, among others, the BancoPosta ring-fenced capital reserve, representing the dedicated assets attributed to Bancoposta RFC, legally autonomous, the Parent Company's legal reserve, the fair value reserve, relating to items recognised at fair value through equity, and the cash flow hedge reserve, reflecting the effective portion of hedging instruments outstanding at the end of the reporting period and the translation reserve which includes the exchange differences from the translation, in the presentation currency, of the financial statements of the consolidated companies that operate with a non-Euro functional currency.

{508}------------------------------------------------

### Retained earnings

This relates to the portion of profit for the period and for previous periods which has not been distributed or taken to reserves or used to cover losses and actuarial gains and losses deriving from the calculation of the liability for employee termination benefits, and transfers from other equity reserves, when they have been released from the restrictions to which they were subjected. In the consolidated financial statements, the item also includes any effects arising from transactions with minority shareholders.

### Insurance contracts

The following policies and classification and measurement criteria refer specifically to the operations of the Poste Italiane Group's insurance companies. in application of the provisions of IFRS 4, replaced in its entirety as of 1 January 2023 by the new accounting standard IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, for the discussion of which reference should be made to *Note 2.5 New accounting standards and interpretations and those soon to be effective*.

Insurance contracts are classified and measured as insurance contracts or finance contracts, based on their prevalent features. Contracts issued by Poste Vita SpA primarily relate to life assurance. In 2010 Poste Assicura SpA began operating in the P&C sector.

Under IFRS 4, contracts that transfer significant insurance risk are considered insurance contracts. These contracts are accounted for and valued in accordance with the principles used to prepare the separate financial statements, observing the applicable laws and regulations142.

Insurance risk is significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause the insurer to pay significant additional economic benefits under any circumstances, other than those that have no identifiable effect on the economic aspect of the transaction, even if the insured event is highly unlikely. The reference accounting standard does not provide a specific indication of the level of significance. Therefore, it is up to the Group insurance companies to define a threshold beyond which the additional payment in the event of the insured event may generate the transfer of a significant insurance risk143.

The separation of a contract, classified as insurance, into deposit component and insurance component is mandatory in some circumstances and optional in others. In the case of separation, which can only occur under certain conditions, the deposit component falls under IFRS 9, while the insurance component falls under IFRS 4. Group insurance companies do not perform this breakdown.

The Group applies the following bases for classification and measurement of these contracts.

Contracts classified as insurance contracts in accordance with IFRS 4: include Class I and Class V life insurance policies, Class III policies that qualify as insurance contracts and P&C insurance contracts. These products are accounted for as follows:

- z insurance premiums are accounted for when the policies are written, recognised as income and classified in revenue; they include annual or single premiums accruing during the period and deriving from insurance contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period, net of cancellations;
- z technical provisions are made in respect of earned premiums to cover obligations to policyholders; such provisions are calculated on an analytical basis for each contract using the prospective method, based on actuarial assumptions appropriate to cover all outstanding obligations. The technical provisions and charges relating to the claims are recognised with the relevant sign as positive income components.

In the case of contracts for separately managed accounts with discretionary participation features144 (DPF, as defined in Appendix A of IFRS 4), IFRS 4 makes reference, as illustrated above, to national GAAP. The contracts are classified as "financial", but accounted for as "insurance" as follows:

- z premiums, changes in technical provisions and other claim expenses are recognised in the same way as the insurance contracts described above;
- z unrealised gains and losses attributable to policyholders are assigned to them and recognised in technical provisions (deferred liabilities payable to policyholders) under the shadow accounting method.

<sup>142.</sup> In detail, reference is made to the provisions of Legislative Decrees no. 173/2997 and no. 209/2005 as well as ISVAP Regulations no. 16, no. 21 and no. 22 (as amended and supplemented by ISVAP measure no. 2771 of 29 January 2010, ISVAP measure no. 2845 of 17 November 2010 and IVASS measure no. 53 of 6 December 2016).

<sup>143.</sup> This threshold, defined by aggregating individual contracts into homogeneous categories based on the nature of the risk transferred to the Company, has been set by Poste Vita SpA's Board of Directors at 5%.

<sup>144.</sup> A contractual right of investors to receive returns on the separately managed account. This category includes contracts relating to the life business and referring to Class I and Class V products that envisage clauses for the revaluation of the insured benefit based on the returns achieved by a separately managed account.

{509}------------------------------------------------

The calculation technique used in applying the shadow accounting method is based on the prospective yield on each separately managed account, considering a hypothetical realisation of unrealised gains and losses over a period which is consistent with the characteristics of the assets and liabilities held in the portfolio. The amount to be recognised as a deferred liability also takes account, for each separately managed account, of contractual obligations, the level of minimum returns guaranteed at the time of concluding the contract and any financial guarantees provided.

### Provisions for risks and charges

Provisions for risks and charges are recorded to cover losses that are either probable or certain to be incurred, for which, however, there is an uncertainty as to the amount or as to the date on which they will occur. Provisions for risks and charges are made when the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured on the basis of management's best estimate of the use of resources required to settle the obligation. The value of the liability is discounted, where the time effect of money is relevant, at a rate that reflects current market values and takes into account the risks specific to the liability. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the expected charge to meet existing obligations at the reporting date. Any effect of the passage of time and the effect of changes in interest rates are shown in the statement of profit or loss. With regard to the risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible, specific information is provided without making any provision. In those rare cases in which disclosure of some or all of the information regarding the risks in question could seriously prejudice the Group's position in a dispute or in ongoing negotiations with third parties, the Group exercises the option granted by the relevant accounting standards to provide limited disclosure.

### Employee benefits

The Short-term employee benefits are those that will be fully paid within twelve months of the end of the year in which the employee provided his or her services. Such benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, holiday pay and sick pay.

The undiscounted value of short-term employee benefits to be paid to employees in consideration of employment services provided over the relevant period is accrued as personnel expenses.

There are two types of post-employment benefit:

- z Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans include employee termination benefits payable to employees in accordance with article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code.

As a result of the supplementary pension reform, for all companies with at least 50 employees, from 1 January 2007 vesting employee termination benefits (TFR) must be paid into a supplementary pension fund or into a Treasury Fund set up by INPS. Accordingly, the company's defined benefit liability is applicable only to the provisions made up to 31 December 2006145. In the case of companies with less than 50 employees, vested employee termination benefits continue to fully increase the accumulated liability for the company.

Under these plans, given that the amount of the benefit to be paid is only quantifiable following the termination of employment, the related effects on profit or loss or the financial position are recognised on the basis of actuarial calculations in compliance with IAS 19. In particular, the liability to be paid on cessation of employment is calculated using the projected unit credit method and then discounted to recognise the time value of money prior to the liability being settled. The liability recognised in the financial statements is based on calculations performed by independent actuaries. The calculation takes into account the employee termination benefits accrued for work already performed and is based on actuarial assumptions that mainly concern: demographic assumptions (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial assumptions (such as rate of inflation and a discount rate consistent with that of the liability). In the case of companies with at least 50 employees, as the company is not liable for employee termination benefits accruing after 31 December 2006, the actuarial calculation of employee termination benefits no longer takes account of future salary increases. Actuarial gains and losses at the end of each reporting period, based on the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the present value of the Group's obligations at the end of the period, due to changes in the actuarial assumptions, are recognised directly in Other comprehensive income.

z Defined contribution plans

Employee termination benefits fall within the scope of defined contribution plans provided the benefits vested subsequent to 1 January 2007 and were paid into a Supplementary Pension Fund or a Treasury Fund at INPS. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised in profit or loss when incurred, based on their nominal value.

<sup>145.</sup> Where, following entry into effect of the new legislation, the employee has not exercised any option regarding the investment of vested employee termination benefits, the Group has remained liable to pay the benefits until 30 June 2007, or until the date, between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2007, on which the employee exercised a specific option. Where no option was exercised, from 1 July 2007 vested employee termination benefits have been paid into a supplementary pension fund.

{510}------------------------------------------------

The Termination benefits payable to employees are recognised as a liability when the entity gives a binding commitment, also on the basis of consolidated relationships and mutual undertakings with union representatives, to terminate the employment of an employee, or group of employees, prior to the normal retirement date or, alternatively, an employee or group of employees accepts an offer of benefits in consideration of a termination of employment. Termination benefits payable to employees are immediately recognised as personnel expenses.

Other long-term employment benefits consist of benefits not payable within twelve months of the end of the reporting period during which the employees provided their services. The net change in the value of any of the components of the liability during the reporting period is recognised in full in profit or loss.

### Share-based payments

Share-based payment transactions may be settled in cash, with equity instruments, or with other financial instruments. Goods or services received or acquired through a share-based payment transaction are recognised at their fair value.

In the case of cash-settled share-based payment transactions:

- z a liability is recognised as a matching entry at cost;
- z if the fair value of the goods or services received or acquired cannot be reliably determined, this value must be estimated indirectly on the basis of the fair value of the liability;
- z the fair value of the liability must be remeasured at the end of each reporting period, recognising any changes in fair value in profit or loss for the period.

In the case of equity-settled share-based payment transactions:

- z an increase in shareholders' equity is recorded as a matching entry at cost;
- z if the fair value of the goods or services received or acquired cannot be reliably determined, this value must be estimated indirectly on the basis of the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the grant date.

In the case of employee benefits, the expense is recognised in personnel expenses over the period in which the employee renders the relevant service.

### Translation of items denominated in currencies other than the euro

Transactions in currencies other than the euro are translated to euro using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at closing exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the euro are recognised in profit or loss.

### Revenue recognition

In accordance with IFRS 15 – *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*, revenue is recognised to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services (the transaction price).

Revenue is recognised on the basis of a 5-step framework, which consists of the following:

- z identify the contract with the customer (sales contracts except lease contracts, insurance contracts, financial instruments and non-monetary exchanges);
- z identify the performance obligations, which can be defined as the explicit or implicit promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer;
- z determine the transaction price;
- z in the case of bundles of goods or services involving different performance obligations, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; to that end, it is necessary to estimate the stand-alone selling price of each component;

{511}------------------------------------------------

- z recognise revenue when or as the entity fulfils the performance obligation, that is upon delivery of the good or service to the customer. Performance obligations can be fulfilled:
	- "at a point in time": in the case of obligations fulfilled at a point in time, revenue is recognised only as control over the good or service is passed to the customer. In that respect, consideration is given not only to the significant exposure to the risks and benefits related to the good or service but also physical possession, customer's acceptance, the existence of legal rights, etc.;
	- "over time": in the case of obligations fulfilled over time, the measurement and recognition of revenue reflect, virtually, the progress of the customer's satisfaction. An appropriate approach is defined to measure progress of the performance obligation (the output method).

Every single supplier obligation with the customer is considered, measured and recognised separately. This approach involves a preliminary accurate analysis of the contract to identify every "single product/service" or every "single component" of a product/ service that the supplier promises to provide, attributing to each the relevant consideration, and to monitor each such obligation during the life of the contract (in terms both of manner and timing of fulfilment and the customer's level of satisfaction).

For revenue recognition purposes, the principle provides for the identification and quantification of the so-called variable components of the consideration (discounts, rebates, price concessions, incentives, penalties and other similar) to include them to supplement or adjust the transaction price. Among the variable components of the consideration, of particular importance are the penalties (other than those provided for compensation for damages): said negative income components are recorded as a direct decrease in revenue, instead of allocating them to a provision for risks and charges.

In the presence of multiple performance obligations, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation to the extent of the consideration that the entity is entitled to receive for the transfer of the relevant goods and services to the customer. The transaction price will be allocated on the basis of the standalone selling price of the goods and services associated with the performance obligation. The standalone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell the goods and services separately to the customer, under similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the standalone selling price is not observable, the Company would need to estimate it considering all the information available (market conditions, information on the customer or the class of customers) and the estimation methods used in similar circumstances.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the contract, if longer than 12 months, while any non-incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to fulfil performance obligations related to a contract that do not qualify for treatment under other standards (IAS 2 – *Inventories*, IAS 16 – *Property*, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 – *Intangible Assets*) are capitalised only if the following conditions are met:

- z the costs related directly to a contract (general and administrative costs are not capitalised);
- z the costs generate or enhance resources;
- z the costs are expected to be recovered.

The Group recognises the obligation to transfer to the customer goods or services for which payment has already been obtained (or for which the customer's consideration is due before the goods and services are provided) classified as liability deriving from the contract.

Revenue from activities carried out in favour of or on behalf of the state is recognised on the basis of the amount effectively accrued, with reference to the laws and agreements in force, taking account, in any event, of the provisions contained in legislation regarding the public finances. The return on the current account deposits held by the MEF is determined using the effective interest method and is recognised as revenue from financial services. The same classification is applied to income from Eurozone government bonds, in which deposits paid into accounts by private customers are invested.

For details on the distinction between revenue from contracts with customers recognised at a point in time or over time, see section "*4.3 Notes to the Statement of profit or loss*".

### Government grants

Government grants are recognised once they have been formally allocated to the Group by the public entity concerned and only if, based on the information available at the end of the year, there is reasonable assurance that the project to which the grant relates will be effectively carried out and completed in accordance with the conditions attached to the grant. Grants are recognised in profit or loss under Other operating income as follows: operating grants in proportion to the costs actually incurred for the project and accounted for and approved to the public entity; grants related to property, plant and equipment are recognised in proportion to the depreciation charged on the assets acquired and used to carry out the project.

{512}------------------------------------------------

### Finance income and costs

Finance income and costs are recognised on an accruals basis based on the effective interest method, i.e. using an interest rate that discounts all cash flows relating to a given transaction in the same way.

Dividends are recognised as finance income when the right to receive payment is established, which generally corresponds with approval of the distribution by the Shareholders Meeting of the investee company. Otherwise, dividends from subsidiaries are accounted for as "Other operating income".

### Earnings per share

In the Poste Italiane Group's consolidated financial statements, earnings per share is determined as follows:

Basic: basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Group's profit for the year by the weighted average number of Poste Italiane SpA's ordinary shares in issue during the period.

Diluted: at the date of preparation of these financial statements no financial instruments have been issued which have potentially dilutive characteristics146.

### Related parties

Related parties within the Group refer to Poste Italiane SpA's direct and indirect subsidiaries and associates. Related parties external to the Group include the MEF and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and associates. The Group's key management personnel are also classified as related parties, as are funds providing post-employment benefits to the Group's employees and the related entities. The state and public sector entities other than the MEF are not classified as related parties. Related party transactions do not include those deriving from financial assets and liabilities represented by instruments traded on organised markets.

### 2.4 Use of estimates

The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on the final values indicated in the financial statements and in the disclosure provided. The preparation of these estimates involves the use of available information and the adoption of subjective assessments, also based on historical experience, used for the formulation of reasonable assumptions for the recognition of operating events. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the impact of any changes is reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision only influences the current period, or also in future periods if the revision influences both current and future periods. Due to their nature, the estimates and assumptions used may vary from year to year and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that in subsequent years, the values recorded in these Financial Statements may also vary significantly as a result of changes in the subjective valuations used.

Accounting treatments that require greater subjectivity in the preparation of estimates are described below, also taking into account the geopolitical uncertainty arising from the war between the European countries Russia-Ukraine and the unique characteristics of the macroeconomic environment of reference recorded during the year (in line with ESMA requirements147).

### Revenue and amounts due from the State

Revenue from activities carried out in favour of or on behalf of the State and Public Administration entities is recognised on the basis of the amount effectively accrued, with reference to the laws and agreements in force, taking account, in any event, of the instructions contained in legislation regarding the public finance. The legal framework of reference is still subject to change

<sup>146.</sup> Diluted earnings per share are calculated by taking into account the potentially dilutive effect of all instruments which can be converted into ordinary shares issued by the Parent Company. The calculation is based on the ratio of profit attributable to the Parent Company, adjusted to take account of any costs or income deriving from the conversion, net of any tax effect, and the weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming conversion of all convertible securities.

<sup>147.</sup> Public statement ESMA 32-63-1320 of 28 October 2022.

{513}------------------------------------------------

and, as has at times been the case, circumstances were such that estimates made in relations to previous financial statements, with effects on the statement of profit or loss, had to be changed. The complex process associated with the determination of receivables, which has not been completed yet, may result in changes in the results for the accounting periods after the period ended 31 December 2022 to reflect variations in estimates, due to future regulatory enactments or following the finalisation of expired agreements to be renewed.

At 31 December 2022, Poste Italiane Group's receivables outstanding with central and local authorities amounted to roughly €958 million (€636 million at 31 December 2021), gross of provisions for doubtful debts.

The table below summarises amounts due from the State.

At 31 December 2022, provisions for doubtful debts reflect receivables for which no provision had been made in the state budget and uncertainty regarding past due amounts due from the Public Administration. For further details, see notes A8 - Trade receivables and A9 - Other receivables and assets.

### Revenue from contracts with customers

The main factors in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers include elements of variable consideration, particularly penalties (other than those related to compensation for damages). Elements of variable consideration are identified at the inception of the contract and estimated as of every close of the accounts for the entire contract term, to take into account new circumstances and changes in the circumstances already considered for the previous estimations. Elements of variable consideration include refund liabilities.

### Provisions for risks and charges

The Group makes provisions for probable liabilities deriving from disputes with staff, suppliers, and third parties and, in general, for liabilities deriving from present obligations. These provisions cover the liabilities that could result from legal action of varying nature, the impact on profit or loss of seizures incurred and not yet definitively assigned, and amounts expected to be refundable to customers where the final amount payable has yet to be determined.

{514}------------------------------------------------

Determination of the provisions for risks and charges involves the use of estimates based on current knowledge of factors that may change over time, potentially resulting in outcomes that may be significantly different from those taken into account in preparing these financial statements.

In order to reflect in the financial statements the risks arising from potential fraud perpetrated against Poste Italiane and, therefore, to determine the accounting impacts associated with the potential risk on tax credits, as described in greater detail in Note A10 - *Tax credits Law no. 77/2020*, without prejudice to compliance with Bank of Italy/CONSOB/Ivass Document no. 9 as to all other aspects related to the accounting recognition of the tax credits in question (see the section "Tax credits Law no. 77/2020" of paragraph 2.3 *Summary of significant accounting policies and measurement criteria* for further details), the decision was taken to refer to the provisions of IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities, with regard to the measurement of the risks in question. The applicability of IAS 37, in order to reflect in the financial statements the risk of not being able to offset the tax credits on which fraud was ascertained, was considered because the possible failure to recover the carrying amount of the tax credits would not derive from a characteristic of the asset being measured or from significant increases in the credit risk after the initial recognition of the asset or, more simply, from the ascertained default of the debtor, but rather from the possibility that, for those ascertained to be cases of fraud, the liability of the assignee - even if a third party in good faith or an offended party to the offence - will also be called to account for assumptions other than the possible irregular use of the tax credit or for use to a greater extent than the tax credit received148. As a result of the in-depth analyses carried out on the tax credits acquired, also with the support of external legal, tax and accounting consultants, a specific provision was estimated, recorded consistently with the above and for clarity in the liability item "Provisions for risks and charges". It should be noted that the determination of the above-mentioned provision necessarily required the application of a significant degree of professional judgement, the main elements of uncertainty of which relate to the outcome of the proceedings under way, the identification of the receivables whose deductions have been assigned are effectively non-existent, and the outcome of the initiatives that will be activated by Poste Italiane to recover the amounts paid to the entities in respect of which cases of fraud have been ascertained.

### Impairment and stage allocation for financial instruments

For the purposes of calculating impairment and determining the stage allocation, the main factors estimated by the Poste Italiane Group are as follows, relating to the internal model developed for Sovereign, Banking and Corporate counterparties:

- z estimates of ratings by counterparty;
- z estimation of the probability of default "PD" for counterparties.

With regard to trade receivables, on the other hand, the Poste Italiane Group does not apply stage allocation in accordance with the Simplified Approach. Impairment, for these items in the Financial Statements, is based on:

- z analytical impairment: when a defined credit threshold is exceeded, the individual credit position is analytically monitored on the basis of internal or external evidence; or
- z forfeit impairment: elaboration of a provision matrix for historical losses.

For further details, see Note 6 - *Risk management*.

### Impairment tests of goodwill, cash generating units and equity investments

Goodwill and other non-current assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – *Impairment of Assets*. Impairment testing involves the use of estimates based on factors that may change over time, potentially resulting in effects that may be significantly different from prior year estimates.

In accordance with the relevant accounting standard, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group identifies the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets (Cash Generating Units - CGUs). The process of identifying such CGUs necessarily involves management's judgement as to the specific nature of the assets and business to which they belong and evidence that the cash inflows from the group of assets are closely interdependent and largely independent of those from other assets (or groups of assets). The number and scope of CGUs are systematically updated to reflect the effects of new aggregation and reorganisation

<sup>148.</sup> As provided for in Article 121, paragraph 4 of Law Decree no. 34/2020, which states "...omissis...Suppliers and transferees shall only be liable for any use of the tax credit in an irregular manner or to an extent greater than the tax credit received...omissis...".

{515}------------------------------------------------

operations carried out by the Group, as well as to take into account those external factors that could affect the ability of assets to generate independent cash inflows.

The current environment - which has resulted in highly volatile markets and great uncertainty with regard to economic projections, characterised by the increase in prices and inflation rates and geopolitical tensions arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the decline of the postal market in which the Group operates, make it difficult to produce reliable economic/financial forecasts.

The most significant impairment tests performed at 31 December 2022 refer to:

### Mail, Parcels and Distribution CGU

In view of the continuing negative economic results, the decline in the postal market and the current macroeconomic scenario characterised by the rise in prices and inflation rates, the Mail, Parcels and Distribution CGU was subjected to an impairment test in order to determine a value in use comparable with the overall carrying amount of net invested capital.

The impairment test of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution CGU was performed, consistent with the previous year and with what was presented to the market, at a consolidated level by including the companies within the same operating segment. Compared to previous years, the companies Plurima, Agile and Sourcesense are included in the explicit cash flows and net invested capital of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution CGU as a result of the acquisitions completed in the current year.

In order to estimate the value in use of the CGU, reference was made to the 2023 Budget approved by Poste Italiane SpA's Board of Directors on 29 March 2023 and to the best economic and financial forecasts for the two-year period 2024-2025 approved at the same meeting by the Board of Directors. In determining the terminal value, calculated on the basis of the last year of explicit forecasts, income was normalised. Reference was also made to the transfer prices that BancoPosta RFC is expected to pay for the services provided by Poste Italiane's distribution network. A long-term growth rate of 2.1% and a WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) of 6.19% were used. The analysis made it possible to conclude positively on the appropriateness of the figures of the financial statements, as well as the related sensitivity analyses on the significant variables that have confirmed the carrying amounts.

As in the past, in determining the value of properties used as post offices and sorting centres, Poste Italiane SpA's universal service obligation was taken into account, as was the inseparability of the cash flows generated from the properties that provide this service, (which the Parent Company is required to operate throughout the country regardless of the expected profitability of each location); the unique nature of the operating processes involved and the substantial overlap between postal and financial activities within the same outlets, represented by post offices, were also considered. On this basis, the value in use of the Parent Company's land and buildings used in operations is relatively unaffected by changes in the commercial value of the properties concerned and, in certain critical market conditions, certain properties may have values that are significantly higher than their market value, without this having any impact on the cash flows or results of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution segment.

The fair value of the Parent Company's properties used in operations continued to be higher than their carrying amount, as confirmed by the property valuations carried out.

{516}------------------------------------------------

### LIS (Payments and Mobile) CGU

Following the Purchase Price Allocation process, details of which are provided in Note 2.6 - *Basis of consolidation*, goodwill of €459 million emerged, equal to the residual difference between the consideration transferred for the acquisition of the LIS Group and the adjusted fair value of the net assets acquired.

In performing the impairment test, reference was made to the CGU consisting of LIS Holding and LIS Pay as the cash-generating unit.

In order to estimate the value in use of the CGU, reference was made to the 2023 Budget and the financial forecasts for the two-year period 2024-2025 approved by the Board of Directors of the respective companies; a long-term growth rate of 2.1% and a WACC of 8.64% were used.

Based on the test results, there was no need to make impairment adjustments at 31 December 2022.

### Investment in Anima Holding SpA

With reference to the impairment test of the investment in Anima Holding SpA, the value in use was determined taking into account available 2023-2025 forecasts, a long-term growth rate of 2.1% and a cost of equity (ke) of 8.34%.

At 31 December 2022, there was no need to make additional adjustments to the negative effect already recognised in the first half of 2022 of €21 million.

### Other equity investments in associates

With reference to the impairment tests of the equity investments in the other associates Financit, Replica Sim and Eurizon Capital Real Asset, no impairment adjustments were found to be necessary at 31 December 2022.

### Depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The cost of fixed assets is depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The useful life is determined at the time of acquisition and is based on historical experience of similar investments, market conditions and expectations regarding future events that may have an impact, such as technological developments. The actual useful life may, therefore, differ from the estimated useful life.

{517}------------------------------------------------

The useful life of the Group's main asset classes is detailed below:

| Property, plant and equipment              | Years                 | % annual depreciation |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Buildings                                  | 40-59                 | 3%-2%                 |
| Structural improvements to own properties  | 18-31                 | 6%-3%                 |
| Plant                                      | 8-23                  | 13%-4%                |
| Light constructions                        | 10                    | 10%                   |
| Equipment                                  | 3-10                  | 33%-10%               |
| Furniture and fittings                     | 3-8                   | 33%-13%               |
| Electrical and electronic office equipment | 3-10                  | 33%-10%               |
| Motor vehicles, automobiles, motorcycles   | 4-10                  | 25%-10%               |
| Leasehold improvements                     | estimated lease term* | -                     |
| Other assets                               | 3-5                   | 33%-20%               |

* Or the useful life of the improvement if shorter than the estimated lease term.

| Investment property                       | Years | % annual depreciation |
|-------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------|
| Property                                  | 39-42 | 3%-2%                 |
| Structural improvements to own properties | 17-18 | 6%                    |

In the case of assets to be handed over, located on land held under concession or sub-concession, on expiry of the concession term, or whilst awaiting confirmation of renewal, any additional depreciation of assets takes into account the probable residual duration of the right to use the assets to provide public services, to be estimated on the basis of the framework agreements entered into with the Public Administration entity, the status of negotiations with the grantors and past experience.

Lastly, with regard to intangible assets, amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and extends systematically on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life (normally 3 years, except for certain applications for which the useful life can be estimated up to a maximum of 5 years).

### La Deferred tax assets

The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on the expectation of taxable income in future years. Assessments of expected taxable income depend on factors which may change over time, impacting on the valuation of the deferred tax assets in the statement of financial position.

### Technical provisions for insurance business

The measurement of technical provisions for the insurance business is based on estimates made by actuaries employed by Poste Vita SpA, based on a series of material assumptions, including technical, actuarial, demographic and financial assumptions, as well as on projections of future cash flows from the insurance contracts entered into by Poste Vita and Poste Assicura and effective at the end of the year.

In order to verify the adequacy of the technical provisions, the Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) is performed periodically. It measures the ability of future cash flows from insurance contracts to cover liabilities to the policyholder149. The LAT is conducted on the basis of the present value of future cash flows, obtained by projecting expected future cash flows from the existing portfolio to the end of the reporting period, based on appropriate assumptions regarding the cause of termination (death, surrender, redemption, reduction) and the performance of claim expenses. If necessary, technical provisions are topped up and the related cost charged to profit or loss.

<sup>149.</sup> For example, with reference to the Life business, the approach adopted for the quantification of technical items useful for the implementation of the LAT consists in the development, for each product line, of a calculation model that replicates the (probable) economic commitments of the Group insurance company over the entire projection horizon coinciding with the residual duration of the contracts. The projections of future cash flows take into account the general and special policy conditions, with particular reference to the time structure of premiums, insured benefits, payments per claim, maturities or redemptions, as well as revaluation clauses and any other contractual options present. Future assumptions express reliable estimates of the probability of exit for the various causes, impacting future cash flows of investment returns, policyholder participation rates, and levels of acquisition and operating expenses.

{518}------------------------------------------------

### Share-based payments

As better described in more detail in Note 13 - *Additional information* - Share-based payment arrangements, an internal pricing tool was used to assess the Share-based payment arrangements in place within the Poste Italiane Group at the close of these financial statements, which adopts simulation models consistent with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards and takes account of the specific characteristics of the Plans. The plan terms and conditions link the award of the related options to the occurrence of certain events, such as the achievement of performance targets and performance hurdles and, in certain areas of operation, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. For these reasons, measurement of the liability, equity reserve and the corresponding economic effects involves the use of estimates based on current knowledge of factors that may change over time, potentially resulting in outcomes that may be significantly different from those taken into account in preparing these financial statements.

### Employee termination benefits

The measurement of Employee termination benefits is also based on calculations performed by independent actuaries. The calculation takes account of termination benefits accrued for the period of service to date and is based on various demographic and economic-financial assumptions.

The main actuarial assumptions applied in the calculation of employee termination benefits at 31 December 2022, also based on the experience of each Group company and the reference best practice, are as follows:

#### Economic and financial assumptions

|                                                          | 31.12.2022 |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Discount rate                                            | 3.63%      |
| Inflation rate                                           | 2.30%      |
| Annual rate of increase of employee termination benefits | 3.225%     |

#### Demographic assumptions

### Determination of the lease liability

To determine the financial lease liability, the Group has opted to use an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) determined in line with a hypothetical loan obtained in the current economic environment, and applied to groups of contracts with similar remaining terms and to similar companies. In particular, each IBR takes account of the risk-free rate identified on the basis of factors such as the economic environment, currency, contract term and credit spread reflecting the companies' organisation and financial structure. The IBR associated with the commencement of the contract will be reviewed whenever there is a lease modification, meaning substantial and significant changes to the contract conditions over the life of the agreement (e.g. the lease term or the amount of future lease payments). The IBR table defined for groups of contracts with similar residual duration and for similar reference companies is periodically monitored and updated at least once during the year.

With regard instead to determination of the lease term at the commencement date or of the remaining term at a later date (in the event of substantial and significant changes to contract conditions) and, in particular, for property leases, the Group uses a val

{519}------------------------------------------------

uation approach based primarily on the expected duration of the obligation as per the agreement between the parties and/or in the legal framework of reference (Law 392 of 27 July 1978), and it expects an extension of the lease due to an interpretation/forecast of events, circumstances and future intentions, including of a strategic nature, of both the lessor and the lessee. This has resulted in a set of rules for determining the lease term, to be applied to leased properties classified previously in three distinct clusters: properties where the lease is subject to legal restrictions and high commercial-value properties; properties for civilian use, such as the company accommodation for Group employees and executives; and other properties used in operations.

The lease term for all of the other agreements was set as equal to the duration of the obligation agreed upon between the parties, in keeping with future intent in wanting and being able to complete the term and past experience.

### Options on minority interests150

In the context of particular corporate transactions, there are call and put options that will allow Poste Italiane to purchase, at certain future dates, shares held by minority shareholders. The exercise price of these options is generally determined on the basis of a formula that provides for the application of a multiplier to certain economic/equity targets of the company acquired. For said cases in the consolidated financial statements, a financial liability has been recognised (in addition to the portion of equity attributable to non-controlling interests), to take account of the possible exercise of options, as matching entry to Group's equity, the value of which depends on estimates made internally and which could change even significantly in the current and future years. Subsequent changes in the value of the financial liability will be reflected in the Group's statement of profit or loss.

For details of the corporate transactions from which the need to recognise this financial liability arose, see *Note B8 - Financial Liabilities*.

### Information on non-financial issues

### Climate change

Climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy are becoming increasingly relevant to businesses, banks, governments, regulators, and investors.

During the year under review the process of identifying and assessing risks and environmental management methods continued, enabling the Poste Italiane Group to pursue the ambitious goal of contributing to the achievement of international carbon neutrality objectives, as specified in greater detail in the section of the Non-Financial Statement to which reference should be made for further details.

Risks related to climate change have been taken into account in the preparation of these financial statements. With particular regard to the accounting treatment reserved for greenhouse gas emission allowances relating to the Group's airline, Poste Air Cargo, as well as guarantees of origin and carbon credits held by the company Postepay and relating to the provision of Energy (electricity and gas) sales services, please refer to "Note 2.3 - *Summary of significant accounting policies and measurement criteria*".

### Macroeconomic environment

The estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements adequately take into account the particular macroeconomic context of reference, at 31 December 2022 heavily impacted by a number of factors such as: pandemic effects, inflation, rising

<sup>150.</sup> An option contract that allows an entity to purchase the interests of minority shareholders of a subsidiary in exchange for cash or other financial assets gives rise to a financial liability in the consolidated financial statements for the present value of the amount payable. Any change in the financial liability from the date of recognition is accounted for with a different balancing entry depending on whether it refers to:

<sup>•</sup> minority shareholders directly interested in the performance of the subsidiary's business with regard to the transfer of risks and benefits on the shares subject to the option. One of the indicators of this interest is the fair value measurement of the option exercise price. In addition to the presence of this indicator, the Group makes a case-by-case assessment of the facts and circumstances that characterise existing transactions. In this case, the discounted value of the option is initially deducted from the Group's equity reserves. Any subsequent changes in the valuation of the option exercise price are reflected in the statement of profit or loss;

<sup>•</sup> minority shareholders not directly interested in the performance of the business (e.g. exercise price of the predetermined option). The exercise price of the option, duly discounted, is deducted from the corresponding amount of Capital and Reserves pertaining to non-controlling interests. Any subsequent changes in the valuation of the option exercise price follow the same logic, with no impact on the statement of profit or loss.

{520}------------------------------------------------

interest rates, deterioration of the economic climate, geopolitical risks and uncertainties on future developments. These uncertainties are reflected in the indicators used as the basis for the estimates. For information on how these uncertainties have been reflected in the estimated PDs used to calculate expected losses, please refer to "*Note 6 - Risk management - Credit Risk*"; while for a full discussion of risks related to the economic environment, please refer to the specific sections of the Report on Operations.

### 2.5 New accounting standards and interpretations and those soon to be effective

### Accounting standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2022

- z Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the purpose of which is to clarify that income from the sale of products made during the testing phase of the asset itself, as well as the related production costs, must necessarily be recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
- z Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets to clarify that, for the purpose of assessing whether a contract is onerous, it is necessary to consider not only the incremental costs of fulfilling the contract (such as labour and direct materials), but also all other costs directly attributable to the contract (such as the depreciation of assets used to fulfil that specific contract).
- z Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations to update the reference in the standard to the Conceptual Framework in the revised version of 2018, without this leading to changes in the provisions of the standard.
- z Amendments to the following accounting standards in the context of routine standard improvement activities with the objective of resolving non-urgent issues related to inconsistencies in the standards or to provide clarifications of terminology:
	- IAS 41 Agriculture;
	- IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards;
	- IFRS 9 Financial Instruments;
	- Illustrative Examples of IFRS 16 Leases.

The adoption of the newly applied accounting standards outlined above has had no impact on the Poste Italiane Group's financial reporting.

### Accounting standards and interpretations soon to be effective

The following are applicable from 1 January 2023:

- z IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. The new accounting standard on insurance contracts, which will fully replace the provisions of IFRS 4, aims to:
	- ensure that an entity provides information that fairly represents the rights and obligations arising from the insurance contracts issued;
	- eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing accounting policies by providing a single principle-based framework to account for all types of insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts); and
	- improve comparability between entities belonging to the insurance sector by providing for specific presentation and disclosure requirements.

The standard changes the representation of the profitability of the insurance business from a presentation of results by volume (premiums issued and claims expenses) to a representation more focused on contract margins.

{521}------------------------------------------------

In accordance with the new accounting standard, it is necessary to identify those contracts that meet the definition of an insurance contract, thus defining the scope of application of the new standard.

The insurance contracts within the scope of application will initially be subdivided according to the year they were underwritten and their profitability. In fact, the standard provides that groups of insurance contracts are, following the performance of an "onerousness test", divided into:

- profitable contracts;
- onerous contracts;
- contracts that at the time of initial recognition do not have a high probability of becoming onerous.

The groups of contracts identified can be measured by applying the General Model (also referred to as the Building Block Approach - BBA); this approach involves defining the cash flows associated with the insurance contract, consisting of:

- future cash inflows and outflows;
- an adjustment that takes into account the time value of money and the financial risks associated with the flows themselves;
- an adjustment for non-financial risk (risk adjustment).

The final result of the sum of the preceding components, if positive, determines the so-called Contractual Service Margin (CSM) that will be issued over the life of the insurance contract according to the so-called Coverage Unit, while if negative the Loss Component, recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

The standard provides for the possibility of using two further measurement models:

- Premium Allocation Approach (PAA), an optional and alternative model to the general model, is applicable to contracts characterised by a coverage period of no more than one year, as well as to groups of contracts for which the company considers that simplification linked to the model would not lead to a significantly different result from that obtained with the general model;
- Variable Fee Approach (VFA), a mandatory measurement model for investment contracts with discretionary participation features, such as separately managed accounts and unit-linked insurance.

The provisions of the new standard are to be applied to insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts issued and held, and investment contracts with a discretionary participation feature (DPF). The preliminary effects resulting from the initial application of IFRS 17 at 1 January 2022 are presented in the section "*Accounting standards and interpretations soon to be effective: ESMA Disclosure - Quantitative impacts*".

- z Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts aimed at introducing a transition option regarding comparative information on financial assets presented at the date of initial application of the new standard, in order to avoid temporary accounting mismatches between financial assets and liabilities of insurance contracts, and thus to improve the usefulness of comparative information for readers of financial statements.
- z Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors aimed at improving disclosure on accounting policies so as to provide more useful information to investors and other primary users of financial statements, as well as to help companies distinguish changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies.
- z Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes to clarify how deferred taxes should be accounted for on certain transactions that may generate assets and liabilities of equal amount, such as leases and decommissioning obligations, with the objective of reducing diversity in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities on such transactions.

Lastly, at the reporting date, the IASB has issued the following amendments, still not yet endorsed by the European Commission:

- z *Amendments IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current e Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants;*
- z *Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback.*

The potential impact on the Poste Italiane Group's financial reporting of the accounting standards, amendments and interpretations due to come into effect is currently being assessed. It should also be noted that the Group has not arranged for the early adoption of any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet in force.

{522}------------------------------------------------

### Accounting standards and interpretations soon to be effective: ESMA disclosure

On 13 May 2022, the European Securities and Markets Authority (hereinafter referred to as ESMA) published Public Statement ESMA32-339-208 "Transparency on implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts"151 with the aim of identifying certain information that listed companies are encouraged to provide in their 2022 Half-Year and Annual Financial Reports regarding the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 17- Insurance Contracts.

The IFRS 17 implementation project was launched by the Poste Italiane Group during 2019 and concerned the insurance companies of the Poste Vita Group (Poste Vita SpA and Poste Assicura SpA) as well as, limited to the related impact on the consolidated financial statements, the Parent Company, with the assistance of a consultant with proven expertise and professionalism. Below we provide some preliminary relevant information required by ESMA concerning the effects of applying IFRS 17.

### Scope of application

The application of the principle requires an analysis of existing contracts in order to identify those that reflect the definition of an "insurance contract", i.e. a contract under which one party accepts a significant insurance risk from another party, agreeing to indemnify the insured or the beneficiary in the event that the latter suffers loss as a result of a specific event, i.e. the insured event.

Therefore, insurance contracts issued by companies belonging to the Poste Vita Group, as well as reinsurance contracts held, fall within the scope of the standard. With regard to the contracts issued by the other Poste Italiane Group companies, no elements were identified that could be brought within the definition of an insurance contract, i.e., although falling within this definition, the Group opted to continue applying IFRS 15 and/or IFRS 9 instead of IFRS 17 as permitted by the new standard.

### Level of portfolio aggregation

The Poste Italiane Group will apply IFRS 17 to its entire portfolio of contracts issued by Group companies and reinsurance contracts held. The level of aggregation defined envisages an initial distinction between Life and P&C business and then a distinction into different Unit Of Accounts that accommodate contracts with similar contractual characteristics and product risk. This classification was also made taking into account the Solvency II Lines of Business, where possible.

### Application of exemption to annual cohorts

As envisaged in the endorsement of the final version of the standard, the Poste Italiane Group will adopt the exemption option relating to the application of the annual cohorts152, limited to the portfolios pertaining to the Line of Business "With Profit Participating" and the hybrid products with separately managed components of Poste Vita. These contracts will therefore not be divided into annual cohorts, but will be managed together by exploiting the mutualisation effect of returns153, typical of segregated managed accounts. No impact on P&C business is expected.

This exemption stems from the fact that in insurance practice, the revaluation rules for insurance liabilities are a function of the returns on the related financial assets, which are calculated through a common management of these assets and therefore not differentiated according to the specific sub-portfolios included in a specific separately managed account or between product generation years. The presence of cohorts generates complexities in terms of quantifying the "mutualisation effect" arising from the inclusion of different Units of Account (new production) in a pool of Units of Account pertaining to pre-existing portfolios, as well as complexities in terms of allocation of return on assets to specific Units of Account that could generate distorting effects in IFRS 17 results.

<sup>151.</sup> Also referred to by ESMA Public Statement 32-63-1320 "European common enforcement priorities for 2022 annual financial reports", which identifies the key information that listed companies are required to present in their 2022 Annual Financial Reports.

<sup>152.</sup> Cohort means the division of contracts according to the year of signing. 153. Intergenerational mutuality is generated on those products of long duration that provide for the entry of policyholders even at different times in the life of the product. In these cases, the mutualisation effect makes it possible to offset losses and gains from portfolio management between the different generations of policyholders participating in the product.

{523}------------------------------------------------

### Discount rate

For the discounting of future cash flows related to insurance contracts, the Group has decided to adopt a "bottom-up approach" for the derivation of discount curves borrowed from Solvency II, in which the reference Basic Risk Free Curve is based on the Risk Free Rate curve provided by EIOPA without Volatility Adjustment (i.e. the measure defined for Solvency II purposes that allows the effects of market volatility to be mitigated).

The Basic Risk Free curve, depending on the specific business, will be adjusted to take into account specific Illiquidity Premiums (a component representing the level of liquidity of the counterparty) calibrated to portfolios or at Company level.

Below are the details of the portfolios:

- z in relation to the Separately managed account participating business and the Unit Linked portfolio connected to Separately managed accounts (Multi-branch products), it was decided to calibrate the IFRS 17 Illiquidity Premium on the basis of the composition of the reference portfolio (e.g. Separately managed accounts or Company) using approaches and metrics borrowed from the Solvency II approach;
- z in relation to the non-participating Life Business and for the Unit Linked portfolio not connected to Separately managed accounts, it was decided to adopt values of Illiquidity Premiums consistent with the Volatility Adjustment value provided by EIOPA, in line with Solvency II;
- z in relation to the P&C Business, it was decided to adopt only the Basic Risk Free curve, thus assuming an Illiquidity Premium of 0, in line with the Solvency II framework.

### Risk adjustment

The Risk Adjustment, i.e. the remuneration that Poste Italiane Group companies charge for taking non-financial risks, will be calculated separately for Life and P&C business. This measure represents an adjustment of the estimated Present Value Future Cash Flow, which will affect the determination of the CSM.

To determine the Risk Adjustment, the Poste Italiane Group decided to use the percentile metric. According to this approach, the Risk Adjustment represents the potential loss in relation to the obligations assumed towards policyholders (Technical Reserves) that companies would incur, at a given level of probability (percentile level), to cover the insurance risks assumed, thus reflecting the companies' risk appetite.

In the identification of the confidence level for the Risk Adjustment, equal to 70% for the Life business and 80% for the P&C business, among other elements, the Solvency II valuation framework was taken into account, considering the same perimeter of underlying risks.

### Evaluation models adopted

The Premium Allocation Approach, adopted exclusively for P&C Business, will be used for all contracts that include one or more of the following features:

- z duration of 720 days or less;
- z single premium with duration ≤ 7 years;
- z multi-year duration and membership of the Collective Business;
- z multi-year duration and belonging to a Portfolio where the weight of the Multi-year Business is less than or equal to 5% in the last 3 financial years.

It is specified that, in order to determine these requirements, sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify which features of the contracts had a non-significant impact in terms of the outcome when applying the PAA compared to those that would have been obtained by applying the BBA.

With reference to the VFA model, adopted exclusively for the Life business, the Group assessed the eligibility for the model for the following types of products:
{524}------------------------------------------------

- z With Profit Participating;
- z Unit-linked standalone insurance;
- z Hybrid products with investment components.

The BBA model will be applied in both P&C and Life business and adopted for portfolios other than those described above.

## Definition of the Contractual Service Margin release pattern choice

With reference to the Life business, the Poste Italiane Group determines the CSM release by adopting a Coverage Unit (CU) based on a Volume-based driver, defined separately for each measurement model adopted:

- z BBA model: the CU is defined with a driver based on the sums insured, which are similar to the lump-sum death benefit for pure risk contracts, and on the mathematical provisions, for annuities (in the payout phase) not under the Separately managed accounts from Long-Term Care products;
- z VFA model: the CU for DPF contracts is defined using a driver based on mathematical provisions.

As part of the CSM release pattern of the P&C business, for contracts valued under the BBA Model, the Group decided to use a release driver based on earned premiums before commissions. The evaluation of the driver also takes into account the effect of any premium refunds and related commission reversals.

## Method of determining contract boundaries

The valuation of a group of insurance contracts must take into account the Contract Boundaries, i.e. the contractual elements that can change the cash flows linked to the contract. The identification of these elements makes it possible to distinguish future cash flows related to existing contracts, which must be included in the estimate at the measurement date, from cash flows that will arise in the future and which must be measured separately in accordance with IFRS 17. The contract boundary identification techniques adopted by the Group are the same as those used in the Solvency II context, with the exception of the case relating to non-cancellable tacit renewals of certain P&C business products, which define a new initial recognition and, therefore, a new cohort.

## Method of determining the investment component

The investment component represents the amount under the insurance contract that the issuing entity must recognise even if the insured event does not occur. The standard expressly requires that this component be displayed separately if distinct. The Group identifies the investment component for certain insurance contracts and defines it as follows:

- z for investment products and annuities in the accumulation phase, the investment component is equal to the difference between the liquidated value and the surrender value net of penalties;
- z for annuities that are certain to be paid out, the value of the investment component corresponds to the value of the benefits paid out.

Finally, with respect to P&C business, the investment component is identified in outward reinsurance contracts that provide scalar or profit sharing.

## Insurance finance income/expenses

The recognition of insurance finance income and expenses, i.e. the effects of changes in the time value of money and financial risk, as required by the standard, will be calculated separately per measurement model:

- z for the VFA portfolio, insurance finance income/expenses will be recognised in the statement of profit or loss or in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in relation to the result of Fair Value Underlying Items defined in accordance with IFRS 9;
- z with regard to the BBA measurement model, finance income and expenses items will be calculated on the basis of the valuation curves adopted for the calculation of IFRS 17 flows.

{525}------------------------------------------------

## Transition method

The Group plans to adopt the Modified Retrospective Approach for the life investment portfolio and the Fair Value Approach for the life pure risk portfolio.

With regard to the P&C business, for the 2021 and earlier cohorts (i.e. for products issued up to 2021) the Fair Value Approach will be adopted, for the 2022 cohort a "Running" approach will be applied as if the standard was already in force on 1 January 2022.

## Interactions between IFRS 17 and IFRS 9

The Poste Italiane Group, and thus also the two insurance companies, has been applying IFRS 9 since 1 January 2018. Following the adoption of IFRS 17, there were no changes to the classification and measurement rules for financial assets.

In order to limit accounting mismatches between IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, the Group plans to adopt the OCI option on the IFRS 17 liability portfolio, with the intention of aligning the financial and mirroring effects between the OCI reserve and the effects on the statement of profit or loss.

## Quantitative impacts

The following table shows the preliminary effects of the initial application of IFRS 17 on the Poste Italiane Group's condensed statement of financial position at the transition date of 1 January 2022, highlighting the main items impacted.

As required by the new accounting standard, the expected profit on contracts (CSM) will be suspended within insurance liabilities and released over the life of the contracts, resulting in an increase in the value of insurance liabilities in the transition from IFRS 4 to the new IFRS 17.

Considering that the accounting, control and validation processes of the IT structure related to the management of IFRS 17 data are currently being finalised, the impact of the application of IFRS 17 at 1 January 2023 and on the statement of profit or loss for the comparative year 2022 will be presented in the next consolidated financial reports.

## 2.6 Basis of consolidation

The Poste Italiane Group's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Poste Italiane SpA and of the companies over which the Parent Company directly or indirectly exercises control, as defined by IFRS 10, from the date on which control is obtained until the date on which control is no longer held by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it simultaneously:

- z has power over the investee;
- z is exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee;
- z has the ability to influence those returns through its power over the investee.

Control is exercised both via direct or indirect ownership of voting shares, and via the exercise of dominant influence, defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity, including indirectly based on legal agreements, obtaining the related benefits, regardless of the nature of the equity interest. In determining control, potential voting rights exercisable at the end of the reporting period are taken into account.

The consolidated financial statements have been specifically prepared at 31 December 2022, after appropriate adjustment, where necessary, to align accounting policies with those of the Parent Company.

Subsidiaries that, in terms of their size or operations, are, either individually or taken together, irrelevant to a true and fair view of the Group's results of operations and financial position are not included within the scope of consolidation.

The criteria used for line-by-line consolidation are as follows:

- z the assets, liabilities, costs and revenue of consolidated entities are accounted for on a line-by-line basis, separating where applicable the equity and profit/(loss) amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated equity and consolidated profit or loss;
- z business combinations, in which control over an entity is acquired, are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business combination is represented by the current value (fair value) at the date of acquisition of the assets sold, the liabilities assumed, the equity instruments issued and any other directly attributable accessory charges; the difference between the acquisition price and the current value of the assets and liabilities acquired, after verifying the correct measurement of the current values of the assets and liabilities acquired and the acquisition cost, if positive, is recorded under Intangible Assets under "Goodwill", or, if negative, is charged to profit or loss;

{527}------------------------------------------------

- z acquisitions of non-controlling interests in entities already controlled by the Group are not accounted for as acquisitions, but as equity transactions; in the absence of a relevant accounting standard, the Group recognises any difference between the cost of acquisition and the related share of net assets of the subsidiary in equity;
- z any significant gains and losses (and the related tax effects) on transactions between companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis, to the extent not yet realised with respect to third parties, are eliminated, as are intercompany payables and receivables, costs and revenue, and finance costs and income;
- z gains and losses deriving from the disposal of investments in consolidated companies are recognised in profit or loss based on the difference between the sale price and the corresponding share of consolidated equity disposed of.

Investments in subsidiaries that are not significant and are not consolidated, and those in companies over which the Group exerts significant influence (assumed when the Group holds an interest of between 20% and 50%), hereinafter "associates", and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. At the time of acquisition, the investment is accounted for using the equity method. Any difference between the cost of acquisition of the investment and the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as follows:

- a. goodwill related to an associate or a joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Amortisation of such goodwill is not permitted;
- b. in determining the initial value of the entity's investment, any excess of the entity's interest in the net fair value of investee's identifiable assets and liabilities over cost is recognised as income in determining the acquirer's interest in the profit (loss) for the period of the associate or joint venture in the period in which the interest is acquired.

After acquisition, appropriate adjustments are made to the entity's share of the profits or losses of the associate or joint venture to account, for example, for additional depreciation or amortisation of the investee's depreciable or amortisable assets, based on the excess of their fair values over their carrying amounts at the time the investment was acquired, and of any impairment losses on goodwill or property, plant and equipment. The equity method is as follows:

- z the Group's share of an entity's post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss from the date on which significant influence or control is obtained until the date on which significant influence or control is no longer exerted by the Group; provisions are made to cover a company's losses that exceed the carrying amount of the investment, to the extent that the Group has legal or constructive obligations to cover such losses; changes in the equity of companies accounted for using the equity method not related to the profit/(loss) for the year are recognised directly in equity;
- z unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Parent Company/subsidiaries and the company accounted for using the equity method are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate; unrealised losses, unless relating to impairment, are eliminated.

# Main changes to the scope of consolidation

During the year, the Parent Company concluded the following business combinations by virtue of which it acquired control of the entities.

## Plurima SpA

On 18 March 2022, Poste Italiane signed a binding agreement with Opus Srl. and the private equity operator Siparex to acquire a majority stake in Plurima SpA ("Plurima") for a consideration based on a total enterprise value of €130 million. The closing took place on 2 May 2022. The transaction was carried out through Poste Welfare Servizi Srl ("PWS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Poste Italiane, and financed with available cash resources.

With the completion of the transaction, PWS holds 70% of the share capital of Plurima Bidco Srl (Bidco), which in turn owns 100% of Plurima. The final consideration paid by BidCo, taking into account the purchase price adjustment defined on the basis of Plurima's net financial position at the date of closing (as regulated between the parties in the sale and purchase agreement), amounted to €135.2 million (difference with net assets acquired at the date of acquisition of €122.7 million).

In addition, Plurima holds 100% of the share capital of Logos Srl. and 60% of the share capital of Bridge Technologies Srl.

{528}------------------------------------------------

Finally, in order to simplify the control structure of the Poste Italiane Group, on 20 June 2022, the reverse merger project of Bidco into Plurima was approved by the respective boards of directors and submitted to the companies' shareholders' meetings. The deed of merger was signed on 22 December 2022 with effect from 1 January 2023.

Below are the carrying amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition of Plurima and its subsidiaries:

* Total value net of goodwill recorded in the financial statements of the acquired companies.

Poste Italiane engaged an independent expert to support the Purchase Price Allocation ("PPA") process, aimed at (i) allocating the Price Consideration to the fair value of the net assets of the acquired entities (regardless of whether or not they are already recognised in the financial statements) and (ii) deriving the goodwill value as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired (expressed net of deferred tax liabilities).

Based on the valuation activities performed to date, an adjustment to the fair value of the net assets acquired totalling €22.0 million was recognised, of which:

- z €30.5 million related to customer contracts and customer-related intangible assets;
- z €8.5 million related to deferred taxation effects connected to the higher value of identified assets.

For the other intangible assets already recognised in the opening financial statements of the acquired companies, as well as for all other assets and liabilities included in the opening statements of financial position of the Plurima Group, the net carrying amount already represents a proxy for fair value.

The remaining difference between the consideration transferred (€135.2 million) and the fair value of the portion of the net assets acquired, adjusted following the PPA process, (€34.5 million) was allocated to Goodwill in the amount of €100.7 million.

The results described above must be considered, at 31 December 2022, still provisional as Poste Italiane has made use of the option provided for in paragraphs 45 et seq. of IFRS 3 to complete the valuation of the business combination within twelve months of the acquisition date.

## LIS Holding SpA

On 14 September 2022, PostePay, following the authorisations received from the AGCM and the Bank of Italy, completed the acquisition of 100% of LIS Holding SpA (together with its subsidiary LIS Pay SpA, "LIS") at a price of €700 million determined on the basis of an enterprise value of €630 million and a conventionally agreed net available cash of €70 million (compared to an actual net available cash at closing of approximately €140 million). At the acquisition date, the difference between the consideration paid to the transferor and the net value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was €595.9 million.

## Sourcesense SpA

On 24 June 2022, Poste Italiane's Board of Directors approved the promotion, in agreement with certain shareholders of Sourcesense SpA ("Sourcesense"), of a voluntary cash takeover bid (OPA) on all the shares and warrants issued by the company. Sourcesense SpA, a company operating in the Information Technology sector in Italy and the United Kingdom, holds 100% of the share capital of the companies Sourcesense Digital Srl., Sourcesense Technology Srl and Sourcesense Limited.

At the end of the offer period (12 September - 21 October 2022), also taking into account the instruments subject to the acceptance and non-acceptance commitment subscribed by the shareholders of Sourcesense who acted in concert with the takeover bid, a number of shares corresponding to 98.37% of the share capital of the issuer and a number of warrants corresponding to 96.03% of those issued were tendered.

As a result of the above, the legal and statutory prerequisites have been created for Poste Italiane to exercise the Squeeze-out Right pursuant to Article 111 of the Consolidated Law on Finance and the Squeeze-out Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the Consolidated Law on Finance "squeeze out"), on the remaining shares and warrants.

On 4 November 2022, the squeeze-out procedure was finalised, as a result of which Poste Italiane holds a controlling stake in Sourcesense of 70%, and the shareholders who acted in concert with Poste Italiane have a minority stake of 30%.

Below are the carrying amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition of Sourcesense and its subsidiaries:

# Conversion of the Financial Statements into foreign currencies

For the purposes of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss of all consolidated companies are expressed in euro, which is the functional currency used by the Parent Company.

The financial statements of companies that operate in a functional currency other than the euro are translated into the presentation currency using the closing rate at the reporting date for assets and liabilities, including goodwill and consolidation adjustments, and the average exchange rate for the period (if this reasonably approximates the exchange rate at the date of the respective transactions) for revenue and costs. All the resulting exchange rate differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and shown separately in a specific equity reserve; this reserve is reversed proportionally to the statement of profit or loss at the time of the (total or partial) disposal of the relevant investment.

The exchange rates used to convert the financial statements of consolidated companies in foreign currencies154 are those published by the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank and presented in the table below:

# 3.2 Other material events

The following material events also occurred in 2022:

## Russia-Ukraine Conflict

The year 2022 was characterised by the beginning of the crisis between the European countries Russia and Ukraine.

In order to assess the impact of the conflict on the Group, as required by the national and international authorities (ESMA and CONSOB)156, an assessment was made of the current and potential future impacts of the sanctions imposed on Russia by state and supranational authorities, on the Group's activities, financial position and results of operations in view of the available evidence and the scenarios that could be envisaged at the date of preparation of the following financial statements.

The potential impacts, although at present random and uncertain also in relation to the pressure on inflation driven by sharp increases in energy and raw material prices, appear limited in relation to the fact that the Group's operations are almost entirely located within the national territory and without branches in the value chain with the countries involved.

In addition, monitoring of the existing relations between the Group and the parties directly or indirectly involved was carried out, which led to the following findings:

- z with reference to the Parent Company, the existence of relations with the corresponding foreign postal administrations of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have credit and debit balances of insignificant amounts;
- z with reference to Poste Vita, within the Multi-asset funds, there are some indirect exposures to the countries involved in the aforementioned events that represent a non-significant portion of the relevant NAV.

## Purchase of treasury shares

In execution of the authorisation to purchase treasury shares resolved by the Shareholders' Meeting of Poste Italiane on 27 May 2022, aimed at acquiring shares to be allocated to directors and employees of the Group who are beneficiaries of the variable incentive plans, the launch of which was communicated to the market on the same date, from 30 May 2022 to 13 June 2022, Poste Italiane purchased no. 2,600,000 treasury shares (equal to 0.199% of the share capital), at an average price of €9.730848 per share, for a total value of €25,300,204.62.

Following the transaction, considering also the treasury shares in the portfolio deriving from previous buy-back transactions and the delivery to the beneficiaries of the incentive plans, Poste Italiane holds 7,535,991 treasury shares, equal to 0.58% of the share capital.

## Interim dividend

On 9 November 2022, Poste Italiane's Board of Directors, in light of the financial position and results of operations of Poste Italiane SpA at 30 June 2022, the performance for the following months, the business outlook and the related expected economic prospects at 31 December 2022, and in line with the Group's dividend policy, resolved to bring forward, as an interim dividend, part of the ordinary dividend for 2022. To this end, the Company has prepared a Report and Financial Statements pursuant to article 2433-bis of the Italian Civil Code, which show that the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows allow such distribution.

The fair value of investment property at 31 December 2022 includes €61 million representing the sale price applicable to the Parent Company's former service accommodation in accordance with Law 560 of 24 December 1993, while the remaining balance reflects market price estimates computed internally by the Company158.

Most of the properties included in this category are subject to lease agreements classifiable as operating leases, given that the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the properties. Under the relevant agreements, tenants usually have the right to break off the lease with six-month notice. Given the resulting lack of certainty, the expected revenue flows from these leases are not referred to in these notes.

<sup>158.</sup> In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, service accommodation and other investment property qualify for Level 3.

* The values shown in the table are rounded in millions of euros (without decimal places). It follows that the sum of the rounded amounts may not coincide with the rounded totals.

As required by IFRS, the equity investments were subjected to an impairment test in order to verify whether there is objective evidence that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Specifically, following this impairment test, the carrying value of the investment in Anima Holding was adjusted, as of 30 June, by €21 million (the effect is shown in the "accounted for using the equity method" column). For the methodology applied and the parameters used to perform the impairment test on Anima Holding at 31 December 2022, please refer to Note 2.4 - *Use of estimates*, with regard to the *Impairment tests of goodwill, cash generating units and equity investments* section. The list and highlights of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method are provided in *Additional Information - Scope of Consolidation and Highlights of Equity Investments* (Note 13).

* The item, "Changes in cash flow hedges", relates to the purchase of forward contracts in relation to cash flow hedge transactions and reflects changes in the fair value of these forward contracts between the date of purchase of the derivative contract and the settlement date, with a matching entry in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve.

#### Loans and receivables

The item Loans refers to reverse repurchase agreements of €4,575 million (€1,577 million at 31 December 2021) entered into with Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia SpA (hereinafter the CC&G) for the temporary use of liquidity from private funding. These transactions are guaranteed by securities for a total notional amount of €4,425 million. Financial assets and liabilities relating to repurchase agreements managed through the CC&G that meet the requirements of IAS 32 are offset. The effect of netting at 31 December 2022, already included in the exposure to net balances, amounted to €3,217 million (€1,577 million at 31 December 2021). At 31 December 2022, the fair value159 of said item was €1,358 million.

#### Receivables include:

- z Deposits with the MEF, for €11,907 million, including public customers' postal current account deposits, which earn a variable rate of return, calculated on a basket of government bonds160. The deposit has been adjusted to reflect accumulated impairments of approximately €5 million, to reflect the risk of counterparty default (unchanged compared to 31 December 2021). During the 2022 financial year, hedging (management) derivative contracts were concluded on the 10-year index-linked remuneration component. The hedging transaction was carried out through forward purchases of the 10-year BTP with settlement of the differential between the pre-set price of the security and its market value.
- z Other financial receivables, relating for €2,457 million to collateral deposits of which €1,447 million for amounts paid to counterparties for repo transactions on fixed-income securities (collateral provided for by specific Global Master Repurchase Agreements), €978 million for amounts paid to CC&G (€613 million for outstanding repo transactions and €365 million as a pre-financed contribution to the Default Fund161), €31 million for amounts paid to counterparties for interest rate swap transactions (collateral provided for by specific Credit Support Annexes). The year-on-year decrease in guarantee deposits is due to the upward shift in the interest rate curve, which mainly generated a decrease in amounts paid to counterparties with which interest rate swap transactions are in place as a result of the positive change in the fair value of hedging derivatives, partially offset by the increase in amounts paid to counterparties with which repo transactions are in place as a result of the negative change in the fair value of collateral securities.

<sup>159.</sup> In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 2.

<sup>160.</sup> The variable rate in question is calculated as follows: 40% is based on the average return on 6-month BOTs recognised monthly and the remaining 60% is based on the average ten-year BTP return recognised monthly.

<sup>161.</sup> A guarantee fund established with payments from participants in the derivative, equity and bond markets, as a further guarantee for the transactions carried out. The fund can be used to meet the charges arising from any participant default.

{553}------------------------------------------------

* The item, "Changes in cash flow hedges", relates to the purchase of forward contracts in relation to cash flow hedge transactions and reflects changes in the fair value of these forward contracts between the date of purchase of the derivative contract and the settlement date, with a matching entry in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve.

### Fixed income instruments

These are mainly Eurozone fixed income Government securities, consisting of government bonds, especially issued by the Italian government, held by BancoPosta RFC, with a nominal value of €37,489 million.

Total fair value fluctuation for the year in question was negative for €10,130 million, with €4,408 million recognised in the relevant equity reserve in relation to the portion of the portfolio not hedged by fair value hedges, and €5,721 million recognised through profit or loss in relation to the hedged portion.

Accumulated impairments at 31 December 2022 amount to €16 million (€12 million at 31 December 2021). The decrease in this item is mainly due to the negative fair value fluctuation mentioned above, partially offset by higher purchases than sales/ reimbursements during the year.

Certain securities are encumbered as they have been delivered to counterparties for use as collateral in connection with loans and hedging transactions, as described in note 13 – *Additional information*.

<sup>162.</sup> In terms of the fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, €20,927 million of the total amount qualifies for inclusion in Level 1 and €2,724 million for inclusion in Level 2.

### Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

This item consists of equity instruments (as defined by art. 2346, paragraph 6 of the Italian Civil Code) resulting from the conversion of Contingent Convertible Notes166, whose value at 31 December 2022 is zero.

<sup>166.</sup> These are Contingent Convertible Notes with an original value of €75 million, a twenty-year term to maturity and issued by Midco SpA, which in turn owns 51% of the airline Alitalia SAI SpA. The Notes were subscribed for by Poste Italiane SpA on 23 December 2014, in connection with the strategic transaction that resulted in Etihad Airways' acquisition of an equity interest in Alitalia SAI, without giving rise to any involvement on the part of Poste Italiane in the management of the issuer or its subsidiary.

On the fulfilment of certain negative pledge conditions, in 2017 the loan was converted into equity instruments (as defined by art. 2346, paragraph 6 of the Italian Civil Code), carrying the same rights associated with the Notes.

The decrease in Amounts due from customers is mainly attributable to the decrease in receivables from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and reflects the new billing and payment methods on a monthly basis and no longer on a quarterly basis, introduced by the Agreement of 23 December 2021, effective from 1 January 2022.

Specifically168:

- z Amounts due from Ministries and Public Administration entities refer mainly to the following services:
	- Compensation for Publisher tariff subsidies, due from the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri Dipartimento dell'Editoria (Cabinet Office – Publishing Department), amounting to €173 million, of which €54 million accrued during the year. These receivables are shown gross of the collection of an unavailable amount of €125 million, relating to the tariff subsidies applied in 2020, 2021 and the first half of 2022, deposited by the Cabinet Office - Publishing Department, in a non-interest-bearing account held by the Parent Company with the State Treasury and for this reason recorded under Payables for advances received. Release of the amount deposited and extinguishment of the receivables in question are awaiting approval from the European Commission. At 31 December 2022, following the integration of the appropriations for the period 2018-2021 in the State Budget 2023, the provisions for doubtful debts, allocated over the years, were released in the amount of approximately €17 million.
	- Integrated Notification and mailroom services rendered to central and local government authorities, amounting to €83 million.
	- Reimbursement of real estate, vehicles and surveillance expenses incurred on behalf of the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (MiMIT) in the amount of €49 million169. This receivable is made up of the remaining €24 million from the original claim of €62 million that was the subject of legal action brought by Poste Italiane for recognition of charges arising from the use of real estate until 2012. On 30 April 2020, a partially favourable judgement was published for Poste Italiane; the judgement was notified to MIMIT and the latter appealed before the Court of Appeal with a request for suspension. On 3 December 2020, the request was not granted and a decision is now pending in the second instance. In December 2021, in compliance with the first instance judgment, MIMIT paid approximately €38 million to the Company, the effects of which were reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. The supplement to the balance consists of €25 million and, during the year, following joint audits, the charges arising from the use of real estate by MIMIT, in the period 2013 - 2021, for a total value of approximately €15 million, were defined. This amount, which had been allocated to the provisions for doubtful debts, was therefore released.
	- Unfranked mail services provided on credit, totalling €38 million, to central and local government authorities.
	- Market Registered Mail services, totalling €38 million, provided to central and local government entities.
	- Mail forwarding and notification services provided following a tender procedure for a total of €30 million.
	- The payment of pensions and vouchers on behalf of INPS (the National Institute of Social Security), totalling €21 million.

<sup>168.</sup> At 31 December 2022, the balance of trade receivables includes €10 million, net of the related provisions for doubtful debts, relating to rental income falling within the scope of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

<sup>169.</sup> See "Revenue and amounts due from the State" below, showing overall amounts due from the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (€50 million), including amounts due for postal and other services.

{564}------------------------------------------------

- z Amounts due for parcel delivery services relate to shipments carried out by the Parent Company and services provided by the subsidiary SDA Express Courier SpA.
- z Amounts due for mail services refer to receivables mainly owed by the Parent Company to private customers who use the "delivery and mailing" range of services.
- z Amounts due from overseas counterparties primarily relates to postal services carried out for overseas postal operators.
- z Amounts due for other BancoPosta services mainly refer to intermediation services (banking, personal loans, mortgages) provided.
- z Amounts due for overdrawn current accounts derive almost exclusively from overruns due to the debiting of BancoPosta's periodic fees.
- z Amounts due from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti refer to fees for BancoPosta RFC's Postal savings deposits service and still not paid.

Provisions for doubtful debts due from customers are described in Note 6 – *Risk management.*

Specifically:

- z The remuneration of current account deposits refers almost entirely to amounts accrued in 2022 and entirely relates to the deposit of funds deriving from accounts opened by Public Administration entities and attributable to BancoPosta RFC. The increase compared to 31 December 2021 is mainly due to the rise in the interest rate curve. In March 2023, €222 million was collected in relation to the remuneration of deposits from accounts opened by the Public Administration.
- z Receivables for Universal Service compensation includes:

	- €1,790 million charged to holders of Interest-bearing Postal Certificates and Class III and V insurance policies for stamp duty at 31 December 2022171; this amount is balanced by a matching entry in "Other taxes payable" until expiration or early settlement of the Interest-bearing Postal Certificates or the insurance policies, i.e. the date on which the tax is payable to the tax authorities (tab. B10.3);
	- €386 million relating to advances paid in relation to stamp duty to be paid in virtual form in 2023 and charged to customers and to be recovered from Poste Italiane's customers;

- z Amounts due from social security agencies and pension funds refer for €14 million to the residual sums relating to periods of suspension or reduction of work for Covid-19, which the Parent Company has advanced to its employees and recoverable through access to the benefits of the Bilateral Solidarity Fund at INPS, enabled by the signing of the labour union agreements

<sup>170.</sup> Of the total amount, a portion of €420 million, assessed on the basis of provisions at 31 December 2021, has yet to be paid and is accounted for in "Other taxes payable" (tab. B10.3).

<sup>171.</sup> Introduced by article 19 of Law Decree 201/2011 converted with amendments by Law 214/2011 in the manner provided for by the MEF Decree of 24 May 2012: Manner of implementation of paragraphs from 1 to 3 of article 19 of Law Decree no. 201 of 6 December 2011, on stamp duty on current accounts and financial products (Official Journal 127 of 1 June 2012).

{566}------------------------------------------------

of 30 April and 21 December 2020. In this regard, during the 2022 financial year, the Parent Company recovered approximately €43 million by means of an adjustment with the contributions due to the Social Security Institute.

- z Receivables relating to fixed-term contract settlements consist of salaries to be recovered following the agreements of 13 January 2006, 10 July 2008, 27 July 2010, 18 May 2012, 21 March 2013, 30 July 2015 and 19 June 2018 between Poste Italiane SpA and the labour unions, regarding the re-employment by court order of personnel previously employed on fixed-term contracts. This item refers to receivables with a present value of €112 million from personnel, from INPS and pension funds recoverable in the form of variable instalments, the last of which is due in 2042. Amounts due from INPS (formerly IPOST) of €42 million, covered by a specific agreement with IPOST dated 23 December 2009. Payment of this amount consists of six instalments of €6.9 million each, falling due between 30 June 2012 and 31 December 2014; negotiations are in progress with the debtor for their recovery.
- z Amounts that cannot be drawn on due to court rulings include €59 million in amounts seized and not assigned to creditors, in the process of recovery, and €12 million in amounts stolen from the Parent Company in December 2007 as a result of an attempted fraud and that have remained on deposit with an overseas bank. In January 2023, following the signing of a settlement agreement, these sums were collected and consequently the provisions for doubtful debts allocated at the time were released to the statement of profit or loss.
- z Interest accrued on IRES refund, refers to interest accruing up to 31 December 2022 in relation to the tax credit determined by an unreported deduction from the IRES tax base of IRAP paid on labour costs and almost entirely attributable to the Parent Company. For the recovery of said receivable, two disputes were brought before the Provincial Tax Tribunal of Rome, which upheld Poste Italiane's appeals, ordering the Agenzia delle Entrate in Rome to refund the amounts claimed. The Agenzia delle Entrate have appealed both judgments before the Regional Tax Tribunal and, on 23 March 2018, the Tribunal upheld the Agenzia delle Entrate 's appeal against one of the judgments (proceedings pursuant to Law Decree no. 201/2011). Poste Italiane has appealed this judgment before the Supreme Court of Cassation. In the last quarter of 2019, the Court of Cassation had the opportunity to rule on other proceedings concerning the operation of the reimbursement pursuant to Law Decree no. 201/11; with respect to the judgement issued, there is a homogeneity of legal-formal circumstances that lead to the conclusion that the principle of law, referred to in the aforementioned judgement of the Court of legitimacy, can also have its effects in existing judgements. Also the judgement concerning Law Decree no. 185/2008, is currently pending before the Supreme Court of Cassation following Poste Italiane's challenge, on 23 January 2023, of the Lazio Regional Tax Tribunal's judgment in favour of the Agenzia delle Entrate. Elements of uncertainty about the final outcome of the case are taken into account in the provisions for doubtful debts due from others.
- z Accrued income and prepaid expenses from trading transactions decreased by €30 million compared to last year. At 31 December 2021, this item included, for approximately €38 million, the one-off payment made in advance to employees in July 2021 to cover the contractual vacancy relating to the first half of 2022, in accordance with what was defined in the renewal of the National Collective Labour Agreement signed on 23 June 2021.
- z Provisions for doubtful debts due from others are described in Note 6 *Risk management*.

#### tab. A10 – Tax Credits Law no. 77/2020

{567}------------------------------------------------

This item refers to tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane SpA against free capital resources or transferred to BancoPosta RFC for resources subject to and not subject to the restriction on their use, in accordance with the provisions of the Relaunch Decree (Law Decree no. 34/2020 converted with amendments by Law no. 77/2020) by which tax breaks were introduced to support Citizens and Businesses to encourage economic recovery following the Covid-19 health emergency.

These credits are measured at amortised cost if they are acquired for the main purpose of offsetting social security or tax liabilities, on the basis of the provisions of the regulations issued with reference to the characteristics of the individual credits, while they are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are also acquired for the purpose of sale.

During the year, tax credits previously measured at fair value through other comprehensive income were reclassified to tax credits at amortised cost. The reclassification, effective as of 1 October 2022, became necessary as a result of the lack of development in the market for second sales between financial intermediaries, which therefore required BancoPosta RFC to revise its business model for these loans.

Changes in these tax credits during 2022 are shown below:

The main changes in the year under review refer to:

- z purchases of €3,471 million, of which €3,174 million pertaining to BancoPosta RFC172;
- z accrued income for the year amounting to €293 million, of which €273 million pertaining to BancoPosta RFC;
- z negative changes in the fair value of tax credits measured at FVTOCI in the amount of €122 million (from 1 January to 30 September 2022);
- z reclassification from the FVTOCI category to amortised cost in the amount of €2,508 million;
- z offsetting of €1,120 million, of which €812 million are attributable to BancoPosta RFC.

The item Other changes includes the positive effects, amounting to €130 million, recognised on 1 October 2022 as an increase in equity, following the reclassification of tax credits to the amortised cost category, partially offset by the derecognition of certain maturing credits not offset during the year.

At 31 December 2022, the fair value173 of tax credits at amortised cost is €8,172 million. At that date, the fair value of only the tax credits subject to reclassification was €2,425 million; the overall change in fair value recognised during the year, of €14 million, would have been recognised in equity in the absence of the reclassification.

As part of the actions aimed at combating tax fraud perpetrated through the monetisation of tax credits, starting from the end of the 2021 financial year, a number of Public Prosecutors' Offices have implemented preventive seizures that, in some cases also involved tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane (some of which were subsequently released from seizure in the course of 2022) for a nominal value of the credits of approximately €410 million, against a value paid to customers that was lower and corresponding to a carrying amount of approximately €334 million at 31 December 2022, including interest capitalised for the recognition at amortised cost of the credits in question.

<sup>172.</sup> With the conversion into Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021, BancoPosta RFC is allowed, as part of the 50% of its funding from private customers that can be invested in securities guaranteed by the Italian State, to use up to 30% of this portion to purchase transferable tax credits. 173. In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 3.

{568}------------------------------------------------

In a regulatory context that is constantly evolving, and taking into account the position taken by the case law174, starting in the second half of the 2022 financial year, on the unusability of tax credits due to conduct unrelated to the transferee and the interpretations of the Agenzia delle Entrate, a legal and accounting analysis was conducted to comprehensively assess the potential risks to which Poste Italiane could be exposed if the tax credits acquired over time by the same were to derive from fraudulent conduct. In particular, in order to determine the accounting impact related to this potential risk, reference was made to the provisions of IAS 37 - *Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities* (as better illustrated in the section *Use of estimates*), as the possible non-recovery of the carrying amount of the tax credits would not derive from a characteristic of the asset being measured or from significant increases in the credit risk after the initial recognition of the asset or, more simply, from the ascertained default of the debtor, as envisaged by the impairment model set forth in IFRS 9, but rather from the possibility that, for what will be ascertained cases of fraud, the liability of the assignee - even if a third party in good faith or an offended party to the crime - will also be called to account for assumptions other than the possible irregular use of the tax credit or for a use in excess of the tax credit received. As a result of the in-depth investigations conducted on the tax credits acquired, also with the support of external legal, tax and accounting consultants, a total provision for these risks of €320 million was recognised under the liability item "Provisions for risks and charges".

It should be noted that the determination of the above-mentioned provision necessarily required the application of a significant degree of professional judgement, the main elements of uncertainty of which relate to the outcome of the proceedings under way, the identification of the receivables whose deductions have been assigned are effectively non-existent, and the outcome of the initiatives that will be activated by Poste Italiane to recover the amounts paid to the entities in respect of which cases of fraud have been ascertained.

The cash and cash equivalents on hand are derived from deposits made in postal current accounts and postal savings products (subscription of postal savings bonds and payments into post office savings books), or from advances withdrawn from the State Treasury to guarantee the operations of post offices. These funds, which are held at post offices (€1,070 million) and at service175 companies (€2,890 million), may not be used for purposes other than to repay obligations contracted in the transactions described above. The decrease with respect to 31 December 2021 is due to the decrease in the item Bank deposits mainly as a result of the purchase of tax credits, pursuant to Law Decree no. 34/2020, through the surplus liquidity deriving from the collection from private individuals deposited on the account opened with the Bank of Italy, partially offset by the increase in the item Cash and cash equivalents due to higher amounts held with the Service Companies*.*

<sup>174.</sup> The Court of Cassation, through a number of rulings made in the course of 2022, confirmed the reconstruction postulated by the Public Prosecutor's Office, recognising the legitimacy of the seizure orders due to the non-existence of the claims subject to the precautionary measure.

The balance of cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2022 includes restricted cash of approximately €3,755 million, of which €1,284 million relates to funds on deposit with the MEF, known as the "Buffer" account, collected from customers and subject to a restriction on their use, €2,259 million consisting of liquidity used to cover insurance technical provisions, €125 million deposited by the Cabinet Office - Publishing Department in a non-interest-bearing account with the State Treasury as an advance on payments for reductions in publisher fees granted by the Parent Company (note A8), €52 million in liquidity to be transferred to principals as part of the management of collections and payments of the subsidiary LIS Pay, €20 million restricted as a result of judicial provisions relating to various disputes and €15 million for management of cash on hand and other restrictions.

(1) Net uses for Personnel expenses amount to €3 million. Service costs (legal assistance) total €3 million.

Specifically:

- z Provisions for operational risks, which mainly relate to liabilities arising from BancoPosta's operations, mainly reflect risks related to the distribution of postal savings products issued in past years, estimated risks for charges and expenses to be incurred as a result of foreclosures suffered by BancoPosta mainly in its capacity as a third party, impairments and adjustments to income from previous years and fraud. The net transfers for the year, totalling €11 million, mainly reflect the prescription of certain stocks related to the funds transfer business and the adjustment of estimates of risks related to the distribution of postal savings products as well as fraud.
- z Provisions for disputes with third parties regard the present value of expected liabilities deriving from different types of legal and out-of-court disputes with suppliers and third parties, the related legal expenses, and penalties and indemnities payable to customers. Movements during the year primarily regard updated estimates of liabilities and uses to cover liabilities settled.
- z Provisions for disputes with staff regard liabilities that may arise following labour litigation and disputes of various types. The changes in the year refer to the update of the estimate of the liabilities and the related legal expenses, taking account of both the overall value of negative outcomes in terms of litigation.
- z Provisions for personnel expenses are made to cover expected liabilities arising in relation to the cost of labour, which are certain or likely to occur but whose estimated amount is subject to change. They have increased by €95 million to reflect the estimated value of new liabilities and decreased as a result of past contingent liabilities that failed to materialise (€35 million) and settled disputes (€77 million).
- z Provisions for early retirement incentives reflect the estimated costs to be incurred as a result of the Group's binding commitment to pay early retirement incentives on a voluntary basis, under the current redundancy scheme agreed with the labour unions for a determinate number of employees who will leave by 31 December 2024. The provisions made at 31 December 2021 were utilised for €218 million.
- z The provisions for risks tax credits Law no. 77/2020 were established to cover probable liabilities analytically described in Note A10 - Tax Credits Law no. 77/2020.
- z Provisions for taxation/social security contributions have been made to cover potential future tax and social security liabilities.
- z Other provisions for risks and charges cover probable liabilities of various type, including: estimated liabilities deriving from the risk that specific legal actions undertaken in order to reverse seizures of the Parent Company's assets may be unable to recover the related amounts, claims for rent arrears on properties used free of charge by the Parent Company, claims for payment of accrued interest expense due to certain suppliers and frauds.

Total net debt/(funds) at 31 December 2022 showed funds of €2,406 million, down €4,752 million from 31 December 2021 (surplus of €7,158 million). The change during the period is largely attributable to the negative valuation effects for the year of approximately €5.2 billion of the investments classified in the FVTOCI category, held mainly by the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit (negative effect of approximately €4.5 billion) and residually by the Strategic Business Units Insurance Services (negative effect of approximately €0.3 billion), Payments and Mobile (negative effect of approximately €0.2 billion) and Postal and Business (negative effect of approximately €0.1 billion). The change also includes a positive operating result of €2.4 billion (of which €1.5 billion is attributable to profit for the period), the positive effect of the change in working capital and taxes of approximately €1.1 billion, capital expenditure of €0.8 billion, dividend payments totalling €0.8 billion (of which €273 million relates to the interim dividend planned for 2022) and other decreases totalling €0.4 billion, mainly attributable to the increase in financial liabilities for leases falling under IFRS 16. Finally, the change includes the negative effect of the acquisition of LIS, Plurima, Sourcesense and Agile for a total of €0.8 billion.

An analysis of the Net debt/(funds) of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution segment at 31 December 2022, in accordance with ESMA recommendation 32-382-1138, is provided below:

Revenue from contracts with customers breaks down as follows:

- z Revenue from mail, parcels and other refers to services provided to customers through the retail and business channels; revenue generated through the retail channel is recognised at a point in time given the number of transactions handled through the various sales channels (post offices, call centres and online) and measured on the basis of the rates applied; revenue generated through the business channel is generally earned as a result of annual or multi-annual contracts and is recognised over time using the output method determined on the basis of shipments requested and handled. These contracts include elements of variable consideration (primarily volume discounts and penalties linked to the quality of service provided) estimated using the expected value method and recognised as a reduction from revenue. In addition, revenue not arising from contracts with customers are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16 - *Leases* and IAS 20 - *Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance*.
- z Net revenue from financial services refers to:
	- revenue from placement and brokerage: these are recognised over time and measured on the basis of the volumes placed, quantified on the basis of commercial agreements with financial institutions. In terms of payment for the collection of postal savings, the agreement entered into with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti envisages payment of a variable consideration on achieving certain levels of inflows, determined annually on the basis of the volume of inflows and expected redemptions; certain commercial agreements, entered into with leading financial partners for the placement of financial products, envisage the return of placement fees in the event of early termination or surrender by the customer;
	- revenue from current account and related services: these are recognised over time, measured on the basis of the ser-

{587}------------------------------------------------

vice rendered (including the related services, e.g. bank transfers, securities deposits, etc.) and quantified on the basis of the contract terms and conditions offered to the customer;

- revenue from commissions on payment of bills by payment slip: this is recognised at a point in time given the number of transactions handled by post offices and quantified on the basis of the terms and conditions in the contract of sale;
- revenue not from contracts with customers accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments*.

#### z Revenue from payments and mobile refers to:

- card payments, collections and payments relating primarily to the cards issued by Postepay recognised at a point in time when issued and the services linked to them recognised over time as the service is used by the customer. These services include interchange fees recognised by international circuits on payment transactions with debit cards detected over time. The item includes commissions for acquiring services rendered to merchants recognised over time due to the use of the service, F23 and F24 proxy acceptance services recognised over time due to the level of service rendered, and PagoPA collection services recognised at a point in time when the service is provided. As of 1 September 2022, services provided by the LIS Group contribute to this item, which mainly include collection and payment services (including pay slip collection services) provided by LIS Pay and recognised at a point in time upon collection, and revenue from the processing of telephone top-ups and network fees and services paid by points of sale to LIS Holding recognised over time due to the use of the service;
- mobile and fixed line telecommunications services, including: revenue from "standard telecommunications offerings" recognised over time using the output method and based on the traffic offered (voice, SIM and data) to the customer; revenue generated by the fixed line "PosteMobile Casa" and "PosteCasa Ultraveloce" offerings, recognised over time using the output method and based on the fee charged to the customer; revenue in the form of SIM activation fees recognised at a point in time when the SIM card is handed over to the customer. Within the Poste Italiane Group, the only mobile and fixed line telecommunications contracts used are in the form of bundles combining two performance obligations to which the implicit discount is allocated on the basis of the related fair value. The revenue from this type of offer, however, is not significant in terms of total revenue from payments and mobile services.

## C1 – Revenue from Mail, Parcels and Other (€3,651 million)

| Total revenue                  | 3,651   | 3,694   | (43)    |

Market revenue showed a decrease compared to the 2021 financial year essentially due to the drop in the traditional mail and parcels market, due both to the normalisation of market trends and to the effects on the economy deriving from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, in addition to the slowdown in incoming flows from China linked to the low value consignment regulations and the restrictive measures to cope with the health emergency, which affected most of the year. The decrease is partly mitigated by the positive contribution from the hospital logistics business conducted by the company Plurima acquired by the Group during the year. In addition, there was a decrease in other revenue, mainly due to the lower contribution of revenue from the PosteMotori Consortium, whose activities are in the process of being concluded.

Universal Service compensation relates to amounts paid by the MEF to cover the costs of fulfilling the USO. Annual compensation, amounting to €262 million, is established in the 2020-2024 Contratto di Programma (Service Contract) in force on 1 January 2020.

{588}------------------------------------------------

Publisher tariff subsidies181 relate to the amount receivable by Poste Italiane from the Cabinet Office - Publishing Department as compensation for the discounts applied to publishers and non-profit organisations when sending mail. The compensation is determined on the basis of the tariffs set in the decree issued by the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (former MiSE) in agreement with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, on 21 October 2010 and Law Decree 63 of 18 May 2012, as converted into Law 103 of 16 July 2012. With AGCom Resolution 454/22/CONS of 30 December 2022, the new universal basic tariffs of the subsidised publishing products included in the Universal Service were defined. The Resolution provided for a gradual increase in basic tariffs as of 1 September 2022, with no impact on the subsidised tariffs paid by senders and with a consequent increase in the compensation received by Poste Italiane per item sent at the subsidised tariff. In this regard, it should be noted that for the year under review, the amount of subsidies that the Parent Company has granted is covered in the 2022 State Budget.

<sup>181.</sup> Law no. 8 of 28 February 2020 - ordered that reimbursements of publishing tariff subsidies to Poste Italiane continue "*for a duration equal to that of the universal postal service*" (i.e. until April 2026). The application of the regulation is subject to approval by the European Commission.

{589}------------------------------------------------

Revenue from financial services showed an increase compared to the 2021 financial year mainly attributable to income from investment of postal current account deposits and free cash balances, partly offset by the decrease in income from postal savings deposits due to the contraction in deposits affected by the macroeconomic environment during the year.

The increase in this item compared to the previous year is mainly attributable to the income from deposits held with the MEF and the income from investments in tax credits.

*Income from investments in securities* relates to interest earned on investment of deposits paid into postal current accounts by private customers. The amount of income includes the impact of the interest rate hedge. The increase in this item with respect to the 2021 financial year is mainly due to the effects of the upward shift in the interest rate curve and the decrease in the fair value hedges in place for early settlements described in Note A6 - *Financial assets*.

*Income from investments in tax credits* relates to interest accrued during the year on the investments described in Note A10 - *Tax Credits Law* no. 77/2020.

*Income from deposits held with the MEF* primarily represents accrued interest for the year on amounts deposited at Public Administration entities, remunerated at a variable rate as described in Note A6 - *Financial assets*. The increase compared to 31 December 2021 is mainly due to the rise in the interest rate curve.

- z Fees for the collection of postal savings deposits relates to remuneration for the provision and redemption of Interestbearing Postal Certificates and payments into and withdrawals from Postal Savings Books. This service is provided by Poste Italiane SpA on behalf of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti under the Agreement renewed on 23 December 2021 to cover the period 2021-2024.
- z Revenue from current account services primarily relates to charges on current accounts, fees on amounts collected and on statements of account sent to customers, annual fees on debit cards and related transactions.
- z Income from the distribution of loan products relates to commissions received by the Parent Company on the placement of personal loans and mortgages on behalf of third parties.

Life gross premiums amounted to €17,179 million. The decrease of €395 million compared to the previous year mainly relates to Branch I products (exclusively for the Multiramo product component).

Although marginal in relation to total net inflows, the contribution of net premiums pertaining to the P&C segment was up from €265 million in 2021 to the current €348 million, due to the growth in all business lines (property, personal and modular protection, payments and welfare protection).

The increase in Income from insurance activities of €64 million compared to the 2021 financial year was mainly attributable to income from financial assets at FVOCI in the amount of €720 million, mainly related to accrued interest, partly offset by the decrease (€689 million) in income from financial instruments at FVPL, due to the conditions in the financial markets. These gains from valuation, which are almost exclusively related to investments included in separately managed accounts, were almost entirely transferred to policyholders through the shadow accounting method.

A breakdown of the change in technical provisions and other claim expenses, showing the portion ceded to reinsurers, is as follows:

These consist of revenue from e-money products and payment services, revenue from mobile telephony services, and residually, starting from the year under review, from the sale of electricity and gas, rendered mainly by PostePay SpA and the LIS Group, which contributes to revenue for the last four months of the year.

Revenue from payment and mobile services posted an increase of €265 million compared to the same period of 2021, with a positive contribution from all segments. Specifically, the E-money and Collection and Payment Services segments, which benefited from the consolidation of the LIS Group as of September 2022, grew thanks to increased payment card operations, growth in acquiring transactions, higher revenue from the PagoPA service to the Public Administration and instant transfers from Postepay Evolution. Telecommunication services also recorded higher revenue compared to the same period in 2021, attributable to higher fixed telephony revenue driven by fibre connectivity service revenue. The positive contribution of the

energy segment from 2022 onwards is also reported following the launch by Postepay of the new energy offer to employees, pensioners and family members of the Group.

Personnel expenses decreased compared to 2021 by €241 million attributable, for the extraordinary component, to lower redundancy incentives, and for the ordinary component, mainly to the reduction in average headcount (about 1,600 FTE less than in 2021), which includes the effect of the entry of resources (about 1,300 in total) from the companies acquired in April (Plurima), September (LIS) and October (Sourcesense and Agile).

Net provisions for disputes with staff and provisions for early retirement incentives are described in note B6 – *Provisions for risks and charges*.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment showed an increase of €40 million compared to 2021, mainly due to higher depreciation and lower impairment losses on property, plant and equipment (€23 million), amortisation of intangible assets (€9 million) related to investments in software applications that became available for use and to gains recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 as a result of company acquisitions made during the year and, residually, to rights of use (€8 million) mainly due to the expansion of the company scope.

## C8 – Capitalised costs and expenses (€41 million)

Capitalised costs and expenses break down as follows:

Other operating costs increased compared to the year of comparison due to higher provisions for risks on tax credits, partly offset by lower net allocations to the remaining items of other provisions for risks and charges due to both updated estimated liabilities and the disappearance of those identified in the past.

For the purposes of reconciliation with the statement of cash flows, in 2022 finance income after both realised gains and foreign exchange gains amounted to €157 million (€136 million in 2021 net of Nexi transaction proceeds).

Finance income decreased by €199 million compared with the previous year. It should be noted that the 2021 financial year benefited from the positive effect of the non-recurring capital gain recognised as a result of the SIA-Nexi transaction in the amount of €225 million.

Income taxes increased by €228 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to higher taxes recognised by the Parent Company as a result of the improved result for the year.

Below is the reconciliation of the Parent Company's theoretical IRES tax rate and the effective tax rate of 35.11%:

With reference to the impairment losses, arising from the derecognition of certain maturing receivables not offset during the year, and the provision for tax credits (see also Note A10 - *Tax Credits Law no. 77/2020*), considering the current uncertainty regarding the relative tax treatment and the Company's need to consult the Agenzia delle Entrate in advance, based on the provisions of IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty of Treatment for Income Tax Purposes, the aforementioned charges have been valued as non-deductible for the purpose of determining income taxes for the year and no deferred tax assets have been recognised on these charges. The possible positive tax effects that may emerge as a result of potential developments in the interpretation of the cases in question and the conclusion of discussions with the Agenzia delle Entrate will be reflected in future financial statements.

Under IAS 12 – Income Taxes, IRES and IRAP credits are offset against the corresponding current tax liabilities, when applied by the same tax authority to the same taxable entity, which has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to exercise this right.

At 31 December 2022, current tax assets/(liabilities) include:

- z the liability of €12 million determined by IRES and IRAP provisions for the year 2022 net of IRES and IRAP advances paid and IRES and IRAP receivables from the previous year;
- z a net liability for a total of €3 million recognised following the response received to the petition filed by the Parent Company with the Agenzia delle Entrate on the IRAP treatment of the components of employee termination benefits. In its reply, the Agenzia delle Entrate indicated a different criterion for the time allocation of these components from that provided for by international accounting standards;
- z assets totalling €45 million (including €12 million recognised by the Poste Vita and €33 million by the Parent Company), relating to participation in the Patent Box scheme and the tax benefit for the Parent Company linked to the Aid to Economic Growth (ACE) for 2016. These assets will become offsettable after the submission of the relevant supplementary tax returns;
- z assets for a total of €14 million related to a request for a tax ruling filed by the Parent Company referring to the tax recognition of income components arising from the management of postal current account balances;
- z the substitute tax credit of €18 million relating to the redemption carried out by the Parent Company during 2018, pursuant to art. 15, paragraph 10 ter of Law Decree no. 185 of 29 November 2008, of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the acquisition of the equity investment in FSIA Investimenti Srl;
- z the substitute tax credit of €8 million relating to the redemption carried out by the Parent Company during the year, pursuant to art. 15, paragraphs 10 bis and 10 ter of Law Decree no. 185 of 29 November 2008, of the goodwill arising from the acquisition of the equity investments in Nexive Group and Sengi Express Limited. The payment of the substitute tax will allow, as of the financial year following the payment for Nexive Group and as of the second financial year following the payment for Sengi Express Limited, the amounts of the redeemed goodwill to be deducted for tax purposes;
- z assets totalling €9 million recognised as a result of the responses received to two requests for a tax ruling filed with the Agenzia delle Entrate concerning the tax effects of application of IFRS 9 and 15. These assets will become compensable after the submission of the relevant supplementary tax returns;
- z the remaining IRES receivable of €1 million to be recovered on the failure to deduct IRAP resulting from the requests filed pursuant to art. 6 of Law Decree no. 185 of 29 November 2008 and art. 2 of Law Decree no. 201 of 6 December 2011, which provided for partial deductibility of IRAP for IRES purposes. It should be noted that during the year, an amount of €4 million was collected from the Parent Company (in this regard, see the information on receivables for related interest in Note A9).

# 4.4 Operating segments

The identified operating segments, which are in line with the Group's strategic guidelines, are as follows:

- z Mail, Parcels & Distribution
- z Financial Services
- z Insurance Services
- z Payments and Mobile

The result for each segment is based on operating profit/(loss) and gains/losses on intermediation. All income components reported for operating segments are measured using the same accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

The following results, which are shown separately in accordance with the management view and with applicable accounting standards, should be read in light of the integration of the services offered by the distribution network within the businesses allocated to all four identified operating segments, also considering the obligation to carry out the Universal Postal Service.

Disclosure about geographical segments, based on the geographical areas in which the various Group companies are based or the location of its customers, is of no material significance. At 31 December 2022, the entities consolidated on a line-by-line basis are mainly based in Italy and, on a residual and insignificant basis in China and the United Kingdom182; customers are mainly located in Italy: revenue from foreign customers does not account for a significant percentage of total revenue. Assets include those deployed by the segment in the course of ordinary business activities and those that could be allocated to it for the performance of such activities.

<sup>182.</sup> Total net revenue from ordinary operations by third parties recognised by the fully consolidated companies based in China and the United Kingdom amounted to €117 million, while EBIT and net trading income amounted to €8 million.

# 5.2 Information on BancoPosta RFC

As required by art. 2, paragraphs 17-octies et seq. of Law 10 of 26 February 2011, converting Law Decree 225 of 29 December 2010, in order to identify ring-fenced capital for the purposes of applying the Bank of Italy's prudential requirements to BancoPosta's operations and for the protection of creditors, at the Shareholders' Meeting held on 14 April 2011 Poste Italiane SpA's shareholder approved the creation of ring-fenced capital to be used exclusively in relation to BancoPosta's operations (BancoPosta Ring-fenced Capital or BancoPosta RFC), as governed by Presidential Decree 144 of 14 March 2001, and established the assets and contractual rights to be included in the ring-fence as well as By-laws governing its organisation, management and control. BancoPosta RFC was provided originally with an initial reserve of €1 billion through the attribution of Poste Italiane SpA's retained earnings. The resolution of 14 April 2011 became effective on 2 May 2011, the date on which it was filed with the Companies' Register. Following on from the Board of Directors' resolution of 25 January 2018 and the subsequent Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of Poste Italiane SpA's shareholders, on 27 September 2018, Poste Italiane injected €210 million of fresh capital into BancoPosta RFC.

In 2021, Poste Italiane SpA placed a hybrid subordinated perpetual bond issue with a non-call period of 8 years aimed at institutional investors. Following this issue, on 30 June 2021, there was an injection of capital into BancoPosta RFC, via the granting of a €350 million perpetual subordinated loan with an 8-year non-call period, under terms and conditions that allow it to be counted as Additional Tier 1 ("AT1") capital, designed to strengthen its leverage ratio.

The separation of BancoPosta from Poste Italiane SpA is only partly comparable to other ring-fenced capital solutions. Indeed, BancoPosta is not expected to meet the requirements of articles 2447 *bis et seq.* of the Italian Civil Code or for other special purpose entities, in that it has not been established for a single specific business but rather, pursuant to Presidential Decree 144 of 14 March 2001, for several types of financial activities to be regularly carried out for an unlimited period of time. For this reason, the above legislation does not impose the 10% limit on BancoPosta's equity, waiving the provisions of the Italian Civil Code unless expressly cited as applicable.

## Nature of assets and contractual rights and authorisations

BancoPosta's assets, contractual rights and authorisations pursuant to notarial deed were conferred on BancoPosta RFC exclusively by Poste Italiane SpA without third-party contributions. BancoPosta's operations consist of those listed in Presidential Decree 144 of 14 March 2001, as amended183, with the exception of activities linked to card payments and payment services, carried out by the subsidiary, PostePay SpA. More details on this aspect are provided below:

- z the collection of all forms of savings deposit from the public in accordance with art. 11, para. 1 of Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 of 1 September 1993 - Consolidated Law on Banking (Testo Unico Bancario, or TUB) - and all related and consequent activities;
- z the collection of savings through postal securities and deposits;
- z payment services, including the issuance, administration and sale of prepaid cards and other payment instruments pursuant to art. 1, para. 2, letter f) numbers 4) and 5), TUB;
- z foreign currency exchange services;
- z promotion and arrangement of loans issued by approved banks and financial brokers;
- z investment and related services pursuant to art. 12, Presidential Decree 144/2001;
- z debt collection services;
- z professional gold trading, on own behalf or on behalf of third parties, in accordance with the requirements of Law 7 of 17 January 2000.

All of the assets and rights arising out of various contracts, agreements and legal transactions related to the above activities have also been conferred on BancoPosta RFC.

Following the receipt of clearance from the Bank of Italy, the Shareholders' Meeting of Poste Italiane held on 29 May 2018 approved the proposed removal of the assets, liabilities and contractual rights attributable to the card payments and payment services business unit from the ring-fence that applies to BancoPosta RFC. On 1 October 2018, this business unit was transferred to the subsidiary PostePay SpA, in assets earmarked for card payments and payment services, in order to enable the

latter to operate as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI)184. In addition, in order to complete the process of centralising e-money on the above-mentioned EMI, on 28 May 2021, Poste Italiane's Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, after obtaining all the authorisations required by law, approved the removal of the restriction on the allocation of BancoPosta RFC, assets and legal relations constituting the so-called "Debit Branch", with the deed of contribution in favour of Postepay SpA taking effect from 1 October 2021.

## BancoPosta RFC's operations

BancoPosta RFC's operations consist of the investment of cash held in postal current accounts, in the name of BancoPosta but subject to statutory restrictions, and the management of third parties' collections and remittances. This latter activity includes the collection of postal savings (Postal Savings Books and Interest-bearing Postal Certificates), carried out on behalf of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and the MEF, and services delegated by Public Administration entities. These transactions involve the use of cash advances from the Italian Treasury and the recognition of financial items awaiting settlement. The specific agreement with the MEF requires BancoPosta to provide daily statements of all cash flows, with a delay of two bank working days with respect to the transaction date.

In compliance with the 2007 Budget Law, from 2007 the Company is required to invest the funds raised from deposits paid into postal current accounts by private customers in Eurozone government securities185. Funds deposited by Public Administration entities are, instead, deposited with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and earn a variable rate of return linked to a basket of government securities, in accordance with a specific agreement with the MEF regarding treasury services, expired on 31 December 2022 and being renewed. In addition, under the agreement with the MEF, expired on 31 December 2022 and being renewed, a percentage of the funds deriving from private customer deposits may be placed in a special "Buffer" account at the MEF, with the objective of ensuring flexibility with regard to investments in view of daily movements in amounts payable to current account holders. These loans bear interest from 1 January 2022186 at a variable rate equal to the Euro Short Term Rate (ESTR)187.

## Cost and revenue allocation and measurement of operations contracted out by BancoPosta RFC

Given the fact that Poste Italiane is a single legal entity, the Company's general accounting system maintains its uniform characteristics and capabilities. In this context, the general principles governing administrative and accounting aspects of BancoPosta RFC are as follows:

- z Identification of transactions in Poste Italiane SpA's general ledgers relating to BancoPosta's ring-fenced operations which are then extracted for recording in BancoPosta's separate ledgers.
- z Allocation to BancoPosta RFC of all relevant revenue and costs; in particular the services rendered by the different functions of Poste Italiane SpA to BancoPosta RFC, are exclusively recorded as payables in BancoPosta's separate books, in special intersegment accounts only, and subsequently settled.
- z Settlement of all incoming and outgoing third party payments by Poste Italiane SpA's Chief Financial Office.
- z Allocation of income taxes based on BancoPosta RFC's separate report after adjusting for deferred taxation.
- z Reconciliation of BancoPosta's separate books to Poste Italiane's general ledger.

<sup>184.</sup> The business unit consists of assets and contractual rights linked to:

*Own products*: prepaid cards (card payments), payment services, acquiring services, tax payments using forms F23/F24 and international money transfers (Moneygram) forming part of the operations carried out independently by the EMI. In particular, these products are issued by the EMI, which is responsible for their conception, development and management, whilst BancoPosta RFC acts as distributor of the products through the Group's physical distribution network.

*Products handled under Service Contracts*: payment products and services and money transfers carried out exclusively within the scope of BancoPosta RFC's operations, as they are "reserved to" the ring-fence by Presidential Decree 144/01. In particular, with the aim of leveraging the infrastructure of the hybrid EMI, BancoPosta has outsourced operations relating to payment products and services issued by BancoPosta, and distributed by BancoPosta through Poste Italiane's physical network, to the EMI under an outsourcing agreement between BancoPosta and the EMI.

<sup>185.</sup> Moreover, following the amendment of art. 1, paragraph 1097 of Law 296 of 27 December 2006, introduced by art. 1, paragraph 285 of the 2015 Stability Law (Law 190 of 23 December 2014), it became possible for BancoPosta RFC to invest up to 50% of its deposits in securities guaranteed by the Italian government. Lastly, with the conversion into Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021, BancoPosta RFC is allowed, as part of the 50% of its funding from private customers that can be invested in securities guaranteed by the Italian State, to use up to 30% of this portion to purchase transferable tax credits pursuant to Law Decree no. 34/2020 (the so-called ""Decreto Rilancio" ") or other transferable tax credits pursuant to current legislation.

<sup>186.</sup> Until 31 December 2021, these deposits are remunerated at a variable rate calculated on the basis of the Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA), the rate applied in overnight lending and calculated as the weighted average of overnight rates for transactions on the interbank market reported to ECB by a panel of banks operating in the euro zone (the biggest banks in all the euro zone countries).

<sup>187.</sup> Rate calculated and published by the ECB using a new methodology consistent with ECB Regulation (EU) no. 1333/2014 of 26 November 2014 and based on uncollateralised fixed-rate overnight deposit facility transactions exceeding €1 million.

{629}------------------------------------------------

Part IV of Chapter 1 of the Supervisory Standards in Bank of Italy Circular 285/2013, addressing specific aspects relating to Poste Italiane in respect of BancoPosta RFC's operations, govern the process of contracting out BancoPosta's corporate functions to Poste Italiane, whilst the outsourcing of operations to entities external to Poste Italiane is covered by the regulations applicable to banks.

In compliance with the Circular, the Regulation governing BancoPosta RFC's contracting out and outsourcing process approved by the Board of Directors188 makes provision for a distinction between control functions and essential or important functions and non-essential or important control functions.

BancoPosta RFC may therefore both outsource operating activities, entering into agreements with third parties, and contract out certain operating or control activities to Poste Italiane functions, agreeing "Specific Operating Guidelines" with the heads of the various functions. The Operating Guidelines establish, among other things, the applicable levels of service and transfer prices and are effective following an authorisation process involving the relevant functions, the Chief Executive Officer and, where required, the Company's Board of Directors. The transfer prices set out in the Operating Guidelines are determined according to objective criteria that reflect the real contribution of the various functions to BancoPosta RFC's results. The transfer prices paid, inclusive of commissions and any other form of remuneration due, are determined on the basis of market prices and tariffs for the same or similar services, identified, where possible, following a benchmarking process. When the specifics and/or the particular nature of a service provided by one of the Issuer's functions do not allow the use of a comparable market price, a cost-based method is used, again with the support of benchmarking to ensure that the price charged is adequate for the service provided. In such a case, an adequate mark-up, defined on the basis of appropriate analyses of comparable subjects, shall be applied. The prices set in each Operating Guidelines can be reduced in the presence of operating losses of the activities outsourced or in case of penalties due to the failure to achieve pre-established service levels, as measured by specific performance indicators. The Operating Guidelines, which expired on 31 December 2022 and are being renewed for the three-year period 2023-2025, were notified to the Bank of Italy pursuant to the Supervisory Provisions, 60 days before the actual start. The Supervisory Authority gave a positive opinion to proceed.

<sup>188.</sup> The Regulation was revised on 24 June 2022.

{630}------------------------------------------------

The relevant transactions, profit or loss and statement of financial position amounts, generated by these relationships are only recorded in BancoPosta RFC's Separate Report. In Poste Italiane SpA's comprehensive accounts intersegment transactions are on the other hand eliminated, and are not presented. The accounting treatment adopted is similar to that provided for by the accounting standards regulating the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements.

## Obligations

Poste Italiane SpA's liability, pursuant to art. 2, paragraph 17-nonies of Law Decree 225 of 29 December 2010 converted into Law 10, to creditors of BancoPosta RFC is limited to the ring-fenced capital, represented by the assets and contractual rights originally allocated or arisen after the separation. Poste Italiane's liability is, however, unlimited with respect to claims arising from actions in tort relating to the management of BancoPosta or for transactions for which no indication was made that the obligation was taken specifically by BancoPosta RFC.

The Regulation approved at the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of Poste Italiane SpA's shareholder on 14 April 2011, and subsequently amended on 12 May 2020, provides that, where necessary, BancoPosta RFC's equity shall be sufficient to ensure that it is able to comply with supervisory capital requirements and is aligned with the risk profile of its operations.

## Separate Report

BancoPosta RFC's Separate Report is prepared in application of Bank of Italy Circular 262 of 22 December 2005 - Banks' Financial Statements: Layouts and Preparation, as amended. The application of these regulations, whilst in compliance with the same accounting standards adopted by Poste Italiane SpA, requires the use of a different basis of presentation for certain components of profit or loss and the statement of financial position compared with the basis of presentation adopted for the statutory financial statements.

In this regard, the following table shows a reconciliation of the components of BancoPosta RFC's equity, as shown in the Company's statement of financial position and in the Separate Report189.

## Further regulatory aspects

Pursuant to art. 2, paragraph 17-undecies of Law Decree 225190 of 29 December 2010, which states that "the assets and contractual rights included in BancoPosta's ring-fenced capital shall be shown separately in the Company's statement of financial position", Poste Italiane SpA's statement of financial position includes a *Supplementary statement showing BancoPosta RFC*.

On 27 May 2014, the Bank of Italy issued specific Supervisory Standards for BancoPosta RFC, which, in taking into account the entity's specific organisational and operational aspects, has established prudential requirements that are substantially in line with those applicable to banks. These include regulations covering the organisational structure and governance, the system of internal controls and the requirements regarding capital adequacy and risk containment.

Furthermore, BancoPosta RFC's Regulation states that "In view of the absence of non-controlling interests in BancoPosta RFC, on approval of Poste Italiane SpA's financial statements, the Shareholders' Meeting shall – on the recommendation of the Board of Directors – vote on the appropriation of the Company's profit for the year, and in particular: the portion of BancoPosta RFC, as shown in the related statement, taking account of its specific rules and, in particular, the need to comply with prudential supervisory capital requirements (...)".

The fair value of investment property at 31 December 2022 includes €61 million representing the sale price applicable to the Parent Company's accommodation in accordance with Law 560 of 24 December 1993, while the remaining balance reflects market price estimates computed internally by the Company191.

Most of the properties included in this category are subject to lease agreements classifiable as operating leases, given that Poste Italiane SpA retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the properties. Under the relevant agreements, tenants usually have the right to break off the lease with six-month notice. Given the resulting lack of certainty, the expected revenue flows from these leases are not referred to in these notes.

<sup>191.</sup> In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, service accommodation and other investment property qualify for Level 3.

Investments in Intangible assets during 2022 amounted to €464 million, including €37 million in internal software development activities and the related expenses, primarily relating to personnel expenses (€33 million). Research and development costs, other than those incurred directly to produce identifiable software used, or intended for use, within the Company, are not capitalised.

The increase in industrial patents and intellectual property rights, totalling €230 million, before amortisation for the year, relates primarily to the purchase and entry into service of new software programmes following the purchase of software licences.

Purchases of intangible assets under construction (€234 million) mainly refer to activities for the development of software for infrastructure platforms and for BancoPosta services.

The balance of intangible assets under construction (€256 million) includes activities regarding the development for software relating to the infrastructure platform (€116 million), for BancoPosta services (€68 million), for support to the sales network (€40 million), for the postal products platform (€18 million) and for the engineering of reporting processes for other Business functions and personnel (€14 million).

During the year, reclassifications were made from Intangible assets under construction to Industrial patents and intellectual property rights amounting to €209 million due to the completion and start-up of new software programmes and the development of existing ones, related to the infrastructure platform (€98 million), BancoPosta services (€52 million), support for the sales network (€32 million), the postal products platform (€17 million) and the engineering of reporting processes for other business and staff functions (€10 million).

The entry 'Goodwill' (€33 million) resulted from the acquisition and subsequent reorganisation of the Nexive Group. Goodwill attributable to Poste Italiane is allocated within the Mail, Parcels and Distribution CGU.

For the purpose of impairment tests of goodwill in the separate financial statements, since all goodwill is attributable to the CGU, it was decided to proceed by recognising the result of the impairment test in the consolidated financial statements, which did not show any impairment losses. For the methodology applied and the parameters used to perform the impairment tests at 31 December 2022, please refer to Note 2.4 - Use of estimates, with regard to the *Impairment tests of goodwill, cash generating units and equity investments section*.

Finally, following the start-up of the Energy Project, Poste Italiane invested around €30 million in application software, of which around €8 million has not yet entered into production.

{638}------------------------------------------------

Further details of the main corporate actions during 2022, are provided in Note 3.1 – *Principal corporate actions*.

The impairment tests required by the related accounting standards have been conducted in order to identify any evidence of impairment. Based on the available information and the impairment test results195, there was no need to adjust the carrying amount of the investments.

In particular, with regard to the controlling equity investments operating in the Mail, Parcels and Distribution business segment, the individual equity investments, although relevant as individual assets from an accounting point of view, do not have autonomous capacity to generate and manage cash flows, in consideration of the Group's organisational model. Therefore, these controlling equity investments do not assume individual relevance for the purposes of carrying out the impairment tests in the separate financial statements, but are aggregated (together with the operating activities carried out directly by the Parent Company) in a single CGU; this approach is linked to the organisational model used by the Group, so that given the inability of the individual equity investments to generate independent cash flows with respect to the other equity investments, it would be impossible to calculate their individual recoverable value, according to the provisions of IAS 36.

<sup>193.</sup> According to the ASSIREVI document, in the case of transactions involving the purchase of a controlling interest from another entity under common control for cash consideration, if the transaction is not carried out at arm's length, any difference between the carrying amount of the business acquired and the transaction consideration constitutes a shareholder transaction. (section 1.1 - Acquisition and Transfer of Business Units).

<sup>194.</sup> With the finalisation of the transaction, Poste Welfare Servizi Srl holds 70% of the share capital of Plurima Bidco Srl, a company engaged in the holding and management of shareholdings, which was specifically set up to acquire 100% of the share capital of Plurima SpA.

<sup>195.</sup> The method applied and the criteria used in conducting impairment tests at 31 December 2022, are described in Note 2.4 – *Use of estimates*, with regard to the *impairment testing of goodwill, cash generating units and investments*.

* The item, "Changes in cash flow hedges", relates to the purchase of forward contracts in relation to cash flow hedge transactions and reflects changes in the fair value of these forward contracts between the date of purchase of the derivative contract and the settlement date, with a matching entry in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve.

### Loans and receivables

The item Loans refers to reverse repurchase agreements of €4,575 million (€1,577 million at 31 December 2021) entered into with Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia SpA (hereinafter the CC&G) for the temporary use of liquidity from private funding. These transactions are guaranteed by securities for a total notional amount of €4,425 million. Financial assets and liabilities relating to repurchase agreements managed through the CC&G that meet the requirements of IAS 32 are offset. The effect of netting at 31 December 2022, already included in the exposure to net balances, amounted to €3,217 million (€1,577 million at 31 December 2021). At 31 December 2022, the fair value196 of said item was €1,358 million.

#### Receivables include:

- z Deposits with the MEF, for €11,907 million, including public customers' postal current account deposits, which earn a variable rate of return, calculated on a basket of government bonds197. The deposit has been adjusted to reflect accumulated impairments of approximately €5 million, to reflect the risk of counterparty default (unchanged compared to 31 December 2021). During the 2022 financial year, hedging (management) derivative contracts were concluded on the 10-year index-linked remuneration component. The hedging transaction was carried out through forward purchases of the 10-year BTP with settlement of the differential between the pre-set price of the security and its market value.
- z Other financial receivables, relating for (i) €2,457 million to collateral deposits of which €1,447 million for sums paid to counterparties for repo transactions on fixed-income securities (collateral under specific Global Master Repurchase Agreements), €978 million for sums paid to CC&G of which €613 million for outstanding repo transactions and €365 million as a pre-funded contribution to the Default Fund198, €31 million for amounts paid to counterparties for interest rate swap transactions (collateral provided for in specific Credit Support Annexes) and (ii) €80 million in receivables due from the subsidiary PostePay SpA for amounts mainly debited in early 2023. The year-on-year decrease in guarantee deposits is due to the upward shift in the interest rate curve, which mainly generated a decrease in amounts paid to counterparties with which interest rate swap transactions are in place as a result of the positive change in the fair value of hedging derivatives, partially offset by the increase in amounts paid to counterparties with which repo transactions are in place as a result of the negative change in the fair value of collateral securities.

<sup>196.</sup> In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 2.

<sup>197.</sup> The variable rate in question is calculated as follows: 40% is based on the average return on 6-month BOTs recognised monthly and the remaining 60% is based on the average ten-year BTP return recognised monthly.

<sup>198.</sup> A guarantee fund established with payments from participants in the derivative, equity and bond markets, as a further guarantee for the transactions carried out. The fund can be used to meet the charges arising from any participant default.

* The item, "Changes in cash flow hedges", relates to the purchase of forward contracts in relation to cash flow hedge transactions and reflects changes in the fair value of these forward contracts between the date of purchase of the derivative contract and the settlement date, with a matching entry in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve*.*

### Fixed income instruments

These are Euro area fixed income securities, consisting of government securities issued mainly by the Italian government with a nominal value of €37,489 million. The total fair value loss for the year amount to €10,126 million, recognised in the relevant equity reserve in relation to the portion of the portfolio not hedged by fair value hedges (negative for €4,405 million) and recognised through profit or loss in relation to the hedged portion (negative for €5,721 million). These instruments are subject to impairments recognised in profit or loss with a matching entry in the relevant equity reserve. Accumulated impairments at 31 December 2022 amount to €16 million (€12 million at 31 December 2021). The decrease in this item is mainly due to the negative fair value fluctuation mentioned above, partially offset by higher purchases than sales/reimbursements during the year.

Certain securities are encumbered as they have been delivered to counterparties for use as collateral in connection with loans and hedging transactions, as described in Note 13 – *Additional information*.

<sup>199.</sup> In terms of the fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, €20,927 million of the total amount qualifies for inclusion in Level 1 and €2,724 million for inclusion in Level 2.

At 31 December 2022, derivative financial instruments include:

- z a cash flow hedging interest rate swap contract entered into in 2013 to protect the cash flows of the €50 million bond issued on 25 October 2013 (Note B.6 - *Financial liabilities*); with this transaction, the Company assumed the obligation to pay the fixed rate of 4.035% and sold the variable rate of the bond, which at 31 December 2022 was 4.282%;
- z by call and put options that will allow Poste Italiane to acquire the shares held by the minority shareholders of MLK Deliveries SpA (as well as the ownership of the Milkman technology for e-commerce applications), the Agile Lab Group and Sourcesense SpA. The exercise price of these options is commensurate with the achievement of certain economic/equity targets by the companies. At 31 December 2022, the value of the options is zero as the price defined in the option is representative of the fair value of the companies.

The following transactions took place during 2022:

- z stipulation and settlement of forward purchases on government bonds for a nominal value of €110 million;
- z stipulation and settlement of transactions to hedge the euro/dollar exchange rate risk of aircraft leasing costs carried out through the subsidiary Poste Air Cargo Srl.

<sup>202.</sup> These are Contingent Convertible Notes with an original value of €75 million, a twenty-year term to maturity and issued by Midco SpA, which in turn owns 51% of the airline Alitalia SAI SpA. The Notes were subscribed for by Poste Italiane SpA on 23 December 2014, in connection with the strategic transaction that resulted in Etihad Airways' acquisition of an equity interest in Alitalia SAI, without giving rise to any involvement on the part of Poste Italiane in the management of the issuer or its subsidiary. Interest and principal payments were provided for in the relevant terms and conditions if, and to the extent that, there was available liquidity. On the fulfilment of certain negative pledge conditions, in 2017 the loan was converted into equity instruments (as defined by art. 2346, paragraph 6 of the Italian Civil Code), carrying the same rights associated with the Notes.

Lastly, in November 2022, the swap contract entered into during the 2020 financial year to hedge the fuel costs of air mail transport carried out through the subsidiary Poste Air Cargo Srl expired

{650}------------------------------------------------

The decrease in Amounts due from customers is mainly attributable to the decrease in receivables from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and reflects the new billing and payment methods on a monthly basis and no longer on a quarterly basis, introduced by the Agreement of 23 December 2021, effective from 1 January 2022.

Specifically203:

- z Amounts due from Ministries and Public Administration entities refer mainly to the following services:
	- Compensation for Publisher tariff subsidies, due from the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri Dipartimento dell'Editoria (Cabinet Office – Publishing Department), amounting to €173 million, of which €54 million accrued during the year. These receivables are shown gross of the collection of an unavailable amount of €125 million, relating to the tariff subsidies applied in 2020, 2021 and the first half of 2022, deposited by the Cabinet Office - Publishing Department, in a non-interest-bearing account held by the Company with the State Treasury and for this reason recorded under Payables for advances received. Release of the amount deposited and extinguishment of the receivables in question are awaiting approval from the European Commission. At 31 December 2022, following the integration of the appropriations for the period 2018-2021 in the State Budget 2023, the provisions for doubtful debts, allocated over the years, were released in the amount of approximately €17 million.
	- Integrated notification and mailroom services rendered to central and local government authorities, amounting to €83 million.
	- Reimbursement of real estate, vehicles and surveillance expenses incurred on behalf of the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (MIMIT)204 in the amount of €49 million205. This receivable is made up of the remaining €24 million from the original claim of €62 million that was the subject of legal action brought by Poste Italiane for recognition of charges arising from the use of real estate until 2012. On 30 April 2020, a partially favourable judgement was published for Poste Italiane; the judgement was notified to MIMIT and the latter appealed before the Court of Appeal with a request for suspension. On 3 December 2020, the request was not granted and a decision is now pending in the second instance. In December 2021, in compliance with the first instance judgment, MIMIT paid approximately €38 million to the Company, the effects of which were reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. The supplement to the balance consists of €25 million and, during the year, following joint audits, the charges arising from the use of real estate by MIMIT, in the period 2013 - 2021, for a total value of approximately €15 million, were defined. This amount, which had been allocated to the provisions for doubtful debts, was therefore released.
	- Unfranked mail services provided on credit, totalling €38 million, to central and local government authorities.
	- Market Registered Mail services, totalling €38 million, provided to central and local government entities.
	- Mail forwarding and notification services provided following a tender procedure for a total of €30 million. – The payment of pensions and vouchers on behalf of INPS (the National Institute of Social Security), totalling €21 million.
- z Amounts due for parcel delivery services refer to receivables from customers using the "national and international express courier" range of services.
- z Amounts due from overseas counterparties primarily relates to postal services carried out for overseas postal operators.
- z Amounts due for mail services refer to receivables to private customers who use the "delivery and mailing" range of services.
- z Amounts due for other BancoPosta services mainly refer to intermediation services (banking, personal loans, mortgages) provided totalling €37 million.
- z Amounts due for overdrawn current accounts derive almost exclusively from overruns due to the debiting of BancoPosta's periodic fees.
- z Amounts due from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti refer to fees for BancoPosta's deposit-taking activities.
- z Provisions for doubtful debts due from customers are described in Note 6 *Risk management*.

<sup>203.</sup> At 31 December 2022, the balance of trade receivables includes €8 million, net of the related provisions for doubtful debts, relating to rental income falling within the scope of IFRS 15 – *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*. 204. Former Ministry of Economic Development.

<sup>205.</sup> See "Revenue and amounts due from the State" below, showing overall amounts due from the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (€50 million), including amounts due for postal and other services.

z The remuneration of current account deposits refers entirely to amounts accrued in 2022 and almost entirely relates to the deposit of funds deriving from accounts opened by Public Administration entities and attributable to BancoPosta RFC. The increase compared to 31 December 2021 is mainly due to the rise in the interest rate curve. In March 2023, €222 million was collected in relation to the remuneration of deposits from accounts opened by the Public Administration.

In the year under review, the Group received €262 million in accrued compensation for the period. The amount of compensation was recognised based on the terms of the new 2020-2024 Service Contract, effective 1 January 2020.

With reference to the amount receivable for 2012, AGCom has recognised a net cost incurred by the Company of €327 million, compared with compensation of €350 million originally recognised. Provision has not been made in the state budget for the remaining €23 million. The Company appealed AGCom's decision on 13 November 2014 before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR).

The outstanding receivable relating to compensation for 2005 was subject to cuts in the budget laws for 2007 and 2008.

Provisions for doubtful debts have been made for the full amount of the above receivables.

Specifically:

- z Substitute tax paid, attributable to BancoPosta RFC, primarily regards:
	- €1,738 million charged to holder of Interest-bearing Postal Certificates for stamp duty at 31 December 2022206; this amount is balanced by a matching entry in "Other taxes payable" until expiration or early extinguishment of the Interestbearing Postal Certificates, i.e. the date on which the tax is payable to the tax authorities (tab. B9.3);
	- €386 million relating to stamp duty to be paid in virtual form in 2023 and to be recovered from customers;
	- €102 million relating to stamp duty to be charged to Postal Savings Book holders, which the Company pays in virtual form as required by law;
	- €8 million in withholding tax on interest paid to current account holders for 2022, which is to be recovered from customers.
- z Amounts due from social security agencies and pension funds refer for €14 million to the residual sums relating to periods of suspension or reduction of work for Covid-19, which the Company has advanced to its employees and recoverable through access to the benefits of the Bilateral Solidarity Fund at INPS, enabled by the signing of the labour union agreements of 30 April and 21 December 2020. In this regard, during the 2022 financial year, the Company recovered approximately €43 million by means of an adjustment with the contributions due to the Social Security Institute.
- z Receivables relating to fixed-term contract settlements consist of salaries to be recovered following the agreements of 13 January 2006, 10 July 2008, 27 July 2010, 18 May 2012, 21 March 2013, 30 July 2015 and 19 June 2018 between Poste Italiane SpA and the labour unions, regarding the re-employment by court order of personnel previously employed on fixed-term contracts. This item refers to receivables with a present value of €112 million from personnel, from INPS and pension funds recoverable in the form of variable instalments, the last of which is due in 2042. A breakdown of the receivables by individual agreement is provided below:

#### tab A9.1 – Receivables from fixed-term contract settlements

Amounts due from INPS (formerly IPOST) of €42 million, covered by a specific agreement with IPOST dated 23 December 2009. Payment of this amount consists of six instalments of €6.9 million each, falling due between 30 June 2012 and 31 December 2014; negotiations are in progress with the debtor for their recovery.

- z Amounts that cannot be drawn on due to court rulings include €59 million in amounts seized and not assigned to creditors in the process of recovery, and €12 million in amounts stolen from the Company in December 2007 as a result of an attempted fraud and that have remained on deposit with an overseas bank. In January 2023, following the signing of a settlement agreement, these sums were collected and consequently the provisions for doubtful debts allocated at the time were released to the statement of profit or loss.
- z Accrued interest on IRES refund, refers to interest accruing up to 31 December 2022 in relation to the tax credit determined by an unreported deduction from the IRES tax base of IRAP paid on labour costs. For the recovery of said receivable, two disputes were brought before the Provincial Tax Tribunal of Rome, which upheld Poste Italiane's appeals, ordering the Agenzia delle Entrate in Rome to refund the amounts claimed. The Agenzia delle Entrate have appealed both judgments before the Regional Tax Tribunal and, on 23 March 2018, the Tribunal upheld the Agenzia delle Entrate 's appeal against one of the judgments (proceedings pursuant to Law Decree no. 201/2011). Poste Italiane has appealed this judgment before the Supreme Court of Cassation. In the last quarter of 2019, the Court of Cassation had the opportunity to rule on other proceedings concerning the operation of the reimbursement pursuant to Law Decree no. 201/11; with respect to the judgement issued, there is a homogeneity of legal-formal circumstances that lead to the conclusion that the principle of law, referred to in the aforementioned judgement of the Court of legitimacy, can also have its effects in existing judgements. Also the judgement concerning Law Decree no. 185/2008, is currently pending before the Supreme Court of Cassation following Poste Italiane's challenge, on 23 January 2023, of the Lazio Regional Tax Tribunal's judgment in favour of the Agenzia delle Entrate. Elements of uncertainty about the final outcome of the case are taken into account in the provisions for doubtful debts due from others.
- z Amounts due from subsidiaries and associates include €23 million in amounts receivable from subsidiaries by Poste Italiane SpA, as the consolidating entity (Note 2.3 – *Summary of significant accounting policies and measurement criteria*). The related amounts are mainly due from the subsidiary PostePay SpA.
- z Accrued income and prepaid expenses from trading transactions decreased by €41 million compared to last year. At 31 December 2021, this item included, for approximately €38 million, the one-off payment made in advance to employees in July 2021 to cover the contractual vacancy relating to the first half of 2022, in accordance with what was defined in the renewal of the National Collective Labour Agreement signed on 23 June 2021.

Provisions for doubtful debts due from others are described in Note 6 – *Risk management*.

This item refers to tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane SpA against free capital resources or transferred to BancoPosta RFC for resources subject to and not subject to the restriction on their use, in accordance with the provisions of the "Decreto Rilancio" (Law Decree no. 34/2020 converted with amendments by Law no. 77/2020) by which tax breaks were introduced to support Citizens and Businesses to encourage economic recovery following the Covid-19 health emergency.

These credits are measured at amortised cost if they are acquired for the main purpose of offsetting social security or tax liabilities, on the basis of the provisions of the regulations issued with reference to the characteristics of the individual credits, while they are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are also acquired for the purpose of sale.

During the year, tax credits previously measured at fair value through other comprehensive income were reclassified to tax credits at amortised cost. The reclassification, effective as of 1 October 2022, became necessary as a result of the lack of development in the market for second sales between financial intermediaries, which therefore required BancoPosta RFC to revise its business model for these loans.

Changes in these tax credits during 2022 are shown below:

The main changes in the year under review refer to:

- z purchases of €3,471 million, of which €3,174 million pertaining to BancoPosta RFC207;
- z accrued income for the year amounting to €293 million, of which €273 million pertaining to BancoPosta RFC;
- z negative changes in the fair value of tax credits measured at FVTOCI in the amount of €122 million (from 1 January to 30 September 2022);
- z reclassification from the FVTOCI category to amortised cost in the amount of €2,508 million;
- z offsetting of €1,120 million, of which €812 million are attributable to BancoPosta RFC.

<sup>207.</sup> With the conversion into Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021, BancoPosta RFC is allowed, as part of the 50% of its funding from private customers that can be invested in securities guaranteed by the Italian State, to use up to 30% of this portion to purchase transferable tax credits.

{656}------------------------------------------------

The item Other changes includes the positive effects, amounting to €130 million, recognised on 1 October 2022 as an increase in equity, following the reclassification of tax credits to the amortised cost category, partially offset by the derecognition of certain maturing credits not offset during the year.

At 31 December 2022, the fair value208 of tax credits at amortised cost is €8,172 million. At that date, the fair value of only the tax credits subject to reclassification was €2,425 million; the overall change in fair value recognised during the year, of €14 million, would have been recognised in equity in the absence of the reclassification.

As part of the actions aimed at combating tax fraud perpetrated through the monetisation of tax credits, starting from the end of the 2021 financial year, a number of Public Prosecutors' Offices have implemented preventive seizures that, in some cases also involved tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane (some of which were subsequently released from seizure in the course of 2022) for a nominal value of the credits of approximately €410 million, against a value paid to customers that was lower and corresponding to a carrying amount of approximately €334 million at 31 December 2022, including interest capitalised for the recognition at amortised cost of the credits in question.

In a regulatory context that is constantly evolving, and taking into account the position taken by the case law209, starting in the second half of the 2022 financial year, on the unusability of tax credits due to conduct unrelated to the transferee and the interpretations of the Agenzia delle Entrate, a legal and accounting analysis was conducted to comprehensively assess the potential risks to which Poste Italiane could be exposed if the tax credits acquired over time by the same were to derive from fraudulent conduct. In particular, in order to determine the accounting impact related to this potential risk, reference was made to the provisions of IAS 37 - *Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities* (as better illustrated in the section *Use of estimates*), as the possible non-recovery of the carrying amount of the tax credits would not derive from a characteristic of the asset being measured or from significant increases in the credit risk after the initial recognition of the asset or, more simply, from the ascertained default of the debtor, as envisaged by the impairment model set forth in IFRS 9, but rather from the possibility that, for what will be ascertained cases of fraud, the liability of the assignee - even if a third party in good faith or an offended party to the crime - will also be called to account for assumptions other than the possible irregular use of the tax credit or for a use in excess of the tax credit received. As a result of the in-depth investigations conducted on the tax credits acquired, also with the support of external legal, tax and accounting consultants, a total provision for these risks of €320 million was recognised under the liability item "Provisions for risks and charges".

It should be noted that the determination of the above-mentioned provision necessarily required the application of a significant degree of professional judgement, the main elements of uncertainty of which relate to the outcome of the proceedings under way, the identification of the receivables whose deductions have been assigned are effectively non-existent, and the outcome of the initiatives that will be activated by Poste Italiane to recover the amounts paid to the entities in respect of which cases of fraud have been ascertained.

These funds, which are held at post offices (€1,070 million)

<sup>208.</sup> In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 3.

<sup>209.</sup> The Court of Cassation, through a number of rulings made in the course of 2022, confirmed the reconstruction postulated by the Public Prosecutor's Office, recognising the legitimacy of the seizure orders due to the non-existence of the claims subject to the precautionary measure.

and at service210 companies (€2,890 million), may not be used for purposes other than to repay obligations contracted in the transactions described above. The decrease with respect to 31 December 2021 is due to the decrease in the item Bank deposits mainly as a result of the purchase of tax credits, pursuant to Law Decree no. 34/2020, through the surplus liquidity deriving from the collection from private individuals deposited on the account opened with the Bank of Italy, partially offset by the increase in the item Cash and cash equivalents due to higher amounts held with the Service Companies*.*

- z The reserve for equity instruments-perpetual hybrid bonds211 includes the perpetual hybrid bond with a non-call period of 8 years for institutional Investors, with a total nominal value of €800 million, issued by Poste Italiane SpA on 24 June 2021, with the aim of strengthening the Group's capital structure, and, in particular, BancoPosta's Leverage Ratio (Basel III) and Tier 1 ratio, as well as Poste Vita's Solvency II ratio, thus helping to support the Group's long-term growth in accordance with the guidelines of the Strategic Plan.
- z The fair value reserve regards changes in the value of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. In 2022, the decreases in fair value totalled €4,608 million, reflecting:
	- a net decrease of €4,405 million in financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and attributable to BancoPosta RFC;
	- a net decrease of €81 million in financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income held outside the ring-fence;
	- for €122 million the net decrease in tax credits pursuant to Law no. 77/2020 measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. On 1 October 2022, the negative fair value reserve totalling €130 million (€93 million net of tax effect) was cancelled as a result of the reclassification of the receivables into the amortised cost tax credit category, as better described in Note A10 - *Tax Credits Law no. 77/2020*.

In addition, during the year, as better described in the preceding paragraphs, following the merger by incorporation of PSIA Srl, Poste Italiane directly held an equity investment in NEXI SpA, whose fair value reserve, accrued from 1 January to the merger date, was negative €240 million.

- z The cash flow hedge reserve represents changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges outstanding. In 2022, the fair value gain of €279 million reflects a net gain of €280 million on derivative financial instruments attributable to BancoPosta RFC and a net loss of €1 million on the value of financial instruments held outside the ring-fence.
- z The Incentive Plans reserve includes the estimate of the valuations for the year relating to the long-term "Performance Share LTIP" incentive plans and the MBO short-term incentive plans, carried out on the basis of the provisions of IFRS 2.
- z The Merger Surplus/Deficit Reserve, which increased compared to 31 December 2021, refers for €330 million to the merger surplus generated following the merger by incorporation into Poste Italiane SpA of the subsidiary PSIA Srl described in Note A5 - *Equity investments*.

## B3 – Availability and distributability of reserves

The following table shows the availability and distributability of Poste Italiane SpA's reserves. Retained earnings include the profit for 2022 of €847 million.

During the year, dividends were distributed for a total of €799 million, based on the following resolutions:

- z on 27 May 2022, the Shareholders' Meeting resolved the distribution dividends of €526 million (dividend per share equal to €0.405), which took place on 22 June 2022 as the balance for 2021, taking into account the interim dividend of €241 million (dividend per share equal to €0.185) already paid in November 2021;
- z on 9 November 2022, Poste Italiane's Board of Directors, in line with the Group's dividend policy, resolved to advance part of the ordinary dividend for 2022 as an interim dividend. The interim dividend of €273 million was distributed on 23 November 2022 (dividend per share of €0.210).

The balance of cash flows from the management of postal savings, amounting to a positive €84 million, represents the balance of withdrawals less deposits during the last two days of the year and cleared early in the following year. The balance at 31 December 2022 consists of €16 million payable to Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and €100 million of amounts due from the MEF for Interest-bearing Postal Certificates issued on its behalf.

Amounts payable due to thefts from Post Offices of €155 million regard the Company's liability to the MEF on behalf of the Italian Treasury for losses resulting from theft and fraud. This liability derives from cash withdrawals from the Treasury to make up for the losses resulting from these criminal acts, in order to ensure that post offices can continue to operate.

<sup>212.</sup> In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 2.

{665}------------------------------------------------

Amounts payable for operational risks for €14 million regard the portion of advances obtained to fund the operations of BancoPosta, in relation to which asset under recovery is certain or probable.

Total net debt217 of the Company at 31 December 2022, as shown above, presents a deficit of €3,380 million, down by €5,319 compared to the values at 31 December 2021 (funds of €1,939 million). The change was mainly attributable to the negative valuation effects of investments classified as FVTOCI in the amount of approximately €4.5 billion, the cash absorption generated by the distribution of dividends totalling €799 million (of which €273 million related to the interim ordinary dividend planned for the 2022 financial year), partially offset by the decrease in working capital of €644 million and the profit for the period of €847 million. In addition, the change also includes the effects of corporate acquisitions in 2022 totalling €173 million and the recapitalisation of Poste Vita SpA, for €500 million, through the subscription of a subordinated, non-convertible capital instrument, and of PostePay SpA, for €700 million, aimed at providing the company with the financial resources needed to complete the acquisition of LIS Holding SpA.

<sup>217.</sup> The Net debt/(funds) includes Tax Credits whose value at 31 December 2022 was €9,021 million. Although these receivables derive from business activities and are classified in the financial statements under other assets, in order to improve the representation of the indicator in question, they have been assimilated to financial assets.

These contracts include elements of variable consideration (primarily volume discounts and penalties linked to the quality of service provided) estimated using the expected value method and recognised as a reduction from revenue.
- z Revenue from BancoPosta Services refers to:
	- revenue from placement and brokerage: these are recognised over time and measured on the basis of the volumes placed, quantified on the basis of commercial agreements with financial institutions. In terms of payment for the collection of postal savings, the agreement entered into with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti envisages payment of a variable consideration on achieving certain levels of inflows, determined annually on the basis of the volume of inflows and expected redemptions; certain commercial agreements, entered into with leading financial partners for the placement of financial products, envisage the return of placement fees in the event of early termination or surrender by the customer;
	- revenue from current account and related services: these are recognised over time, measured on the basis of the service rendered (including the related services, e.g. bank transfers, securities deposits, etc.) and quantified on the basis of the contract terms and conditions offered to the customer;
	- revenue from commissions on payment of bills by payment slip: these are recognised at a point in time given the number of transactions handled by post offices and quantified on the basis of the terms and conditions in the contract of sale;
	- revenue not from contracts with customers accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments*.

Market revenue showed an increase compared to the year 2021, essentially attributable to mail revenue, which was mainly affected by the growth in revenue from integrated services due to the resumption of activities for the notification of administrative and judicial documents, as well as the resumption of mailings of tax bills, affected last year by the continuing effects of the pandemic. This growth was partially offset by the expected structural decline in revenue from traditional mail business.

Universal Service compensation relates to amounts paid by the MEF to cover the costs of fulfilling the USO. Annual compensation, amounting to €262 million, is established in the 2020-2024 Contratto di Programma (Service Contract) in force on 1 January 2020.

Publisher tariff subsidies218 relate to the amount receivable by the Company from the Cabinet Office - Publishing Department as compensation for the discounts applied to publishers and non-profit organisations when sending mail. The compensation is determined on the basis of the tariffs set in the decree issued by the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (former MiSE) in agreement with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, on 21 October 2010 and Law Decree 63 of 18 May 2012, as converted into Law 103 of 16 July 2012. With AGCom Resolution 454/22/CONS of 30 December 2022, the new universal basic tariffs of the subsidised publishing products included in the Universal Service were defined. The Resolution provided for a gradual increase in basic tariffs as of 1 September 2022, with no impact on the subsidised tariffs paid by senders and with a consequent increase in the compensation received by the Company per item sent at the subsidised tariff. In this regard, it should be noted that for the year under review, the amount of subsidies that the Company has granted is covered in the 2022 State Budget.

<sup>218.</sup> Law no. 8 of 28 February 2020 - ordered that reimbursements of publishing tariff subsidies to Poste Italiane continue "*for a duration equal to that of the universal postal service*" (i.e. until April 2026). The application of the regulation is subject to approval by the European Commission.

*Income from investments in securities* relates to interest earned on investment of deposits paid into postal current accounts by private customers. The amount of income includes the impact of the interest rate hedge.

*Income from deposits held with the MEF* primarily represents accrued interest for the year on amounts deposited at Public Administration entities, remunerated at a variable rate as described in Note A6 - *Financial assets*. The increase compared to 31 December 2021 is mainly due to the rise in the interest rate curve.

{683}------------------------------------------------

Expenses from financial activities increased compared to the 2021 financial year mainly due to higher interest expenses recognised to public customers for deposits on postal current accounts, as a result of the rise in the interest rate curve, partially offset by lower expenses for losses from the realisation of financial instruments.

Costs for goods and services increased by a total of €11 million compared to the 2021 financial year. This trend is mainly attributable to the increase in costs generated by the international inflationary scenario exacerbated by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the fees associated with the increased use of cloud technology, partly offset by lower costs incurred under the service contract with the subsidiary PostePay SpA related to the lower volumes of pay slips recognised during the year.

Personnel expenses decreased by €248 million compared to 2021, attributable, for the extraordinary component, to lower redundancy incentives, and for the ordinary component, mainly to the reduction in average headcount (about 1,500 FTE less than in 2021).

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment showed an increase of €29 million compared to the year ended 2021, mainly due to higher depreciation and lower reversals of impairment losses on property, plant and equipment (€20 million), on rights of use (€4 million) mainly due to the expansion of the leased fleet, and amortisation on intangible assets (€5 million) related to investments in software applications that became available for use during the year.

Other costs and charges increased compared to the year of comparison due to higher provisions for risks on tax credits, partly offset by lower net allocations to the remaining items of other provisions for risks and charges due to both the updating of estimated liabilities and the disappearance of those identified in the past, see Note B4 - *Provisions for risks and charges*.

Finance income increased year-on-year in 2021 mainly due to interest accrued and paid on the subordinated, non-convertible capital instrument issued by the subsidiary Poste Vita SpA in 2021 and subscribed by Poste Italiane.

With reference to the impairment losses, arising from the derecognition of certain maturing receivables not offset during the year, and the provision for tax credits (see also Note A10 - *Tax Credits Law no. 77/2020*), considering the current uncertainty regarding the relative tax treatment and the Company's need to consult the Agenzia delle Entrate in advance, based on the provisions of IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty of Treatment for Income Tax Purposes, the aforementioned charges have been valued as non-deductible for the purpose of determining income taxes for the year and no deferred tax assets have been recognised on these charges. The possible positive tax effects that may emerge as a result of potential developments in the interpretation of the cases in question and the conclusion of discussions with the Agenzia delle Entrate will be reflected in future financial statements.

* This item refers to receivables for withholding taxes.

In Under IAS 12 – Income Taxes, IRES and IRAP credits are offset against the corresponding current tax liabilities, when applied by the same tax authority to the same taxable entity, which has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to exercise this right.

At 31 December 2022, current tax assets/(liabilities) include:

- z liabilities of €39 million relating to all companies participating in tax consolidation determined by IRES and IRAP provisions for the year 2022 net of IRES and IRAP advances paid and IRES and IRAP receivables from the previous year;
- z a net liability for a total of €3 million recognised following the response received to the petition filed by the Company with the Agenzia delle Entrate on the IRAP treatment of the components of employee termination benefits. In its reply, the Agenzia delle Entrate indicated a different criterion for the time allocation of these components from that provided for by international accounting standards;
- z assets totalling €43 million, of which €33 million related to the Patent Box regime for the 2015-2019 financial years and the tax benefit recognised to the Company related to the Economic Growth Allowance (ACE) for the 2013 and 2016 financial years, and €10 million related to the residual Patent Box asset transferred by the subsidiary Poste Vita SpA to Poste Italiane. These assets will become compensable after the submission of the relevant supplementary tax returns;
- z assets for a total of €14 million related to a request for a tax ruling referring to the tax recognition of income components arising from the management of postal current account balances;
- z the substitute tax credit of a residual €18 million relating to the redemption carried out by the Company during 2018, pursuant to art. 15, paragraph 10 *ter* of Law Decree no. 185 of 29 November 2008, of the higher values resulting from the notes to the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017, of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the acquisition of the investment in FSIA Investimenti Srl;
- z the substitute tax credit of €8 million relating to the redemption carried out by Company during the year, pursuant to art. 15, paragraphs 10 *bis* and 10 *ter* of Law Decree no. 185 of 29 November 2008, of the goodwill arising from the acquisition of the Nexive Group and Sengi HK investments. The payment of the substitute tax will allow, as of the financial year following the payment for Nexive Group and as of the second financial year following the payment for Sengi HK, the amounts of the redeemed goodwill to be deducted for tax purposes;
- z assets totalling €9 million recognised as a result of the responses received to two requests for a tax ruling filed with the Agenzia delle Entrate concerning the tax effects of application of IFRS 9 and 15. These assets will become offsettable after the submission of the relevant supplementary tax returns.

{692}------------------------------------------------

Lastly, the remaining IRES receivable of €4 million was collected on the failure to deduct IRAP resulting from the requests filed pursuant to art. 6 of Law Decree no. 185 of 29 November 2008 and art. 2 of Law Decree no. 201 of 6 December 2011, which provided for a partial deductibility of IRAP for IRES purposes (in this regard, see as reported on receivables for related interest in Note A9).

# 6. Risk Management

# Introduction

The note on "Risk management" is common to both the Poste Italiane Group and Poste Italiane SpA and deals with both financial risk (as defined by IFRS 7) and other types of risk that the Group deems it appropriate or necessary to disclose, and also the provisions of the Public Statement ESMA 32-63-1320 published on 28 October 2022.

Quantitative disclosures for Poste Italiane SpA alone are provided in the specific section of this note, unless otherwise indicated.

# Financial Risks

Information on financial risk management at 31 December 2022 is provided below, in accordance with the requirements of the international financial reporting standard, IFRS 7 – *Financial Instruments: Disclosures*.

Responsibility for coordinating and managing investment and hedging strategies related to BancoPosta RFC and Poste Italiane has been assigned to BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR.

Poste Italiane SpA financial activities, related to treasury management, medium-term funding transactions, including capital market transactions, and extraordinary and subsidised finance are the responsibility of the Parent Company's Administration, Finance and Control function.

Management of the Group's financial transactions and of the associated risks relates mainly to the operations of Poste Italiane SpA and the Poste Vita insurance group.

z Poste Italiane SpA's financial transactions primarily relate to BancoPosta's operations, asset financing and liquidity investment.

BancoPosta RFC's operations consist in the active management of liquidity generated by postal current account deposits, carried out in the name of BancoPosta but subject to statutory restrictions, and collections and payments on behalf of third parties. The funds raised by private customers on postal current accounts must be used in euro area government securities and, for a portion not exceeding 50% of the funds raised, in other securities backed by the Italian government guarantee220, whilst deposits by Public Administration entities are deposited with the MEF. Moreover, within the 50% of deposits from private customers that can be invested in Italian government-guaranteed securities, BancoPosta RFC may use up to a maximum of 30% of that portion to purchase tax credits transferable pursuant to Law Decree no. 34/2020 (the so-called "Decreto Rilancio") and subsequent amendments and additions, or other tax credits transferable pursuant to current legislation221.

The investment profile is based on the constant monitoring of habits of current account holders and the use of a statistical/ econometric model that forecasts the interest rates and maturities typical of postal current accounts. Accordingly, the portfolio composition aims to replicate the financial structure of current accounts by private customers. Management of the relationship between the structure of deposits and investments is handled through an appropriate Asset & Liability Management system. The above-mentioned model is thus the general reference for the investments, in order to limit exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risks. The prudential requirements introduced by the third revision of the Bank of Italy Circular 285/2013 require BancoPosta to apply the same regulations applicable to banks in terms of its controls, establishing that its operations are to be conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Law on Banking (TUB) and the Consolidated Law on Finance (TUF). BancoPosta RFC is, therefore, required to establish a system of internal controls in line with the provisions of Circular 285222,

<sup>220.</sup> As provided for by Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent amendments provided for by the 2015 Stability Law, no. 190 of 23 December 2014.

<sup>221.</sup> As provided for in Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021.

<sup>222.</sup> See in particular the provisions laid down in Part I – Section IV – Chapter 3.

{704}------------------------------------------------

which, among other things, requires definition of a Risk Appetite Framework (RAF223), the containment of risks within the limits set by the RAF, protection of the value of assets and against losses, and identification of material transactions to be subject to prior examination by the risk control function.

BancoPosta's capital structure, which is subject to the prudential provisions introduced with the 3rd update of Bank of Italy Circular 285/2013, is particularly solid due to its CET1 ratio, which stood at 20.3% at 31 December 2022. With reference to the Leverage Ratio, the latter had a value, again at year-end, of 2.9%; the evolution of the indicator compared to 31 December 2021 was mainly affected by the loss of the benefits of the sterilisation of the items "Cash and deposits with the central bank", applied until the first quarter of 2022 due to the Covid emergency.

By contrast, operations not covered by BancoPosta RFC, primarily relating to management of the Parent Company's own liquidity, are carried out in accordance with investment guidelines, which require the Company to invest in instruments such as government securities, high-quality corporate or bank bonds, term bank deposits and tax credits. Liquidity is also deposited in postal current accounts, subject to the same requirements applied to the investment of deposits by private current account holders.

- z Financial instruments held by the insurance company, Poste Vita SpA, primarily relate to investments designed to cover its contractual obligations to policyholders on traditional life policies and unit-linked policies. Other investments in financial instruments regard investment of the insurance company's free capital.
Traditional Life policies, classified under Class I and V, primarily include products whose benefits are revaluated based on the return generated through the management of pools of financial assets, which are separately identifiable in accounting terms only, within the company's assets (so-called separately managed accounts). In the case of policies sold in previous years, the Company has guaranteed a minimum return payable at maturity on such products (at 31 December 2022, this minimum return at maturity on existing policies ranged between 0% and 2.1%). Gains and losses resulting from measurement are attributed in full to policyholders and accounted for in specific technical provisions under the shadow accounting method. The calculation technique used by the Group in applying this method is based on the prospective yield on each separately managed account, considering a hypothetical realisation of unrealised gains and losses over a period of time that matches the assets and liabilities held in the portfolio (see note 2.3 in relation to "Insurance contracts").

The impact of financial risk on investment performance can be absorbed in full or in part by the insurance provisions. In particular, this absorption is generally based on the level and structure of guarantees of minimum returns and the profit-sharing mechanisms of Separately Managed Accounts for the policyholder. The company determines the sustainability of minimum returns through periodic analyses using an internal financial-actuarial (Asset-Liability Management) model which simulates, for each separate portfolio, the change in value of the financial assets and the expected returns under a "central scenario" (based on current financial and commercial assumptions) and under stress and other scenarios based on different sets of assumptions. This model makes it possible to manage the risks assumed by Poste Vita SpA on a quantitative basis, thereby fostering reduced earnings volatility and optimal allocation of financial resources.

Unit-linked products, relating to Class III insurance products, regard policies where the premium is invested in mutual investment funds. The Company constantly monitors the evolution of the risk profile of individual products.

Poste Assicura SpA's investment policies are designed to preserve the Company's financial strength, as outlined in the framework resolution approved by the Board of Directors of Poste Vita SpA on 5 December 2022. Regular analyses of the macroeconomic context and market trends for the different asset classes, with the relevant effects on asset-liability management, are conducted. For the P&C business, the focus is on the management of liquidity in order to meet claims.

Within the above context, balanced financial management and monitoring of the main risk/return profiles are carried out and ensured by dedicated organisational structures that operate separately and independently. In addition, specific processes are in place governing the assumption and management of and control over financial risks, including the progressive introduction of appropriate information systems.

In this regard, on 16 February 2021, Poste Italiane SpA's Board of Directors adopted a revised version of the Guidelines for Internal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR), which contains integrated guidelines for Poste Italiane SpA's Internal Control and Risk Management System.

From an organisational viewpoint, the model consists of:

- z the Control and Risk Committee, established in 2015 within the Board, has the task of supporting, through an appropriate investigative, proposal-making and advisory activity, the evaluations and decisions of the Board of Directors on the internal control and risk management system and on the approval of the relative periodic financial and non-financial reports;
<sup>223.</sup> The RAF consists of a framework that defines, in keeping with the maximum acceptable risk, the business model and strategic plan, the risk appetite, risk tolerance thresholds, risk limits, and risk management policies, together with the processes needed to define and implement them.

{705}------------------------------------------------

- z the Financial and Insurance Services Committee, established on 19 March 2018 has the objective of overseeing the process of developing the products and services distributed by BancoPosta, in order to take a uniform, integrated view of the entire offering and to monitor the performance of the financial investments in which private customer deposits are invested;
- z an Investment Committee established at the Group's insurance company, Poste Vita SpA, which, based on analyses by the relevant functions, provides advice to senior management on the development, implementation and oversight of investment strategy;
- z appropriate functions established within the Parent Company and the subsidiaries providing financial and insurance services (BancoPosta Fondi SGR SpA and Poste Vita SpA) that perform Risk Measurement and Control activities, ensuring the organisational separation of risk assessment from risk management activities; the results of these activities are examined by the relevant advisory Committees, which are responsible for carrying out an integrated assessment of the main risk profiles.

In constructing the Risk Model used by BancoPosta RFC, account was also taken of the existing prudential supervisory standards for banks and the specific instructions for BancoPosta, published by the Bank of Italy on 27 May 2014 with the third revision of Circular 285 of 17 December 2013.

## Fair value interest rate risk

This is the risk that the value of a financial instrument fluctuates as a result of movements in market interest rates.

This refers to the effects of changes in interest rates on the price of fixed rate financial instruments or variable rate financial instruments converted to fixed rate via cash flow hedges and, to a lesser degree, the effects of changes in interest rates on the fixed components of variable-rate financial instruments or fixed rate financial instruments converted to variable rate via fair value hedges. The impact of these effects is directly related to the financial instrument's duration.

The following interest rate sensitivity analysis was based on changes in fair value with a parallel shift in the forward yield curve of +/- 100 bps. The sensitivities data shown by the analysis provide a base scenario that can be used to measure potential changes in fair value, in the presence of changes in interest rates.

{706}------------------------------------------------

The table below shows the sensitivity analysis for the fair value interest rate risk at 31 December 2022 for the Poste Italiane Group's positions.

- z forward sales of government bonds with a nominal value of €1,099 million, and forward purchase contracts for a nominal value of €3,433 million, classified as cash flow hedges, entered into by BancoPosta RFC;
- z a derivative contract entered into by the Parent Company to protect cash flows relating to the variable-rate bond for a nominal value of €50 million.

At 31 December 2022, with reference to the interest rate risk exposure determined by the average duration224, the duration of BancoPosta's overall investments went from 5.39 to 5.01. On the other hand, with respect to Class I and Class V policies sold by Poste Vita SpA, the duration of the matching assets went from 7.34 at 31 December 2021 to 6.95 at 31 December 2022, whilst the duration of the liabilities went from 9.42 to 7.50 (assessment of the duration was carried out using the new Coherent Duration method225). The financial instruments intended to cover the technical provisions for Class III policies have maturities that match those of the liabilities.

# Spread risk

This is the risk of a potential fall in the value of bonds held, following deterioration in the creditworthiness of issuers. This is due to the importance that the impact of the spread of returns on government securities had on the fair value of euro zone government and corporate securities, reflecting the market's perception of the credit rating of issuers.

The value of the portfolio of bonds issued or guaranteed by the Italian government is much more sensitive to the credit risk associated with the Italian Republic than to changes in so-called risk-free interest rates. This is due to the fact that changes in credit spreads are not hedged and regard the entire securities portfolio, meaning both the fixed and variable-rate components. In this latter case, in fact, fair value derivatives, used to convert variable-rate instruments, hedge only the risk-free interest rate risk and not credit risk. This means that a change in the credit spread has an equal impact on both fixed and variable instruments.

The 2022 financial year was characterised by an increase in yields on Italian government bonds (the 10-year BTP fell from 1.17% to 4.72%), which brought the BTP-Bund spread to 214 basis points compared to 135 last year. These movements led to a reduction in the price of securities.

The performance of the Group's portfolio in the period under review is as follows:

- i. the portfolio of *Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income* held by Poste Italiane SpA (notional amount of approximately €37 billion) has undergone an overall net decrease in fair value of approximately €10 billion: this change was partly recognised in profit or loss for an amount of approximately €6 billion relating to the change in the fair value of securities hedged against interest rate risk, whilst the change in the fair value of unhedged securities and the spread risk component (not hedged) was reflected in consolidated equity for approximately €4 billion;
<sup>224.</sup> Duration is the indicator used to estimate the percentage change in price in response to a shift in market returns.

<sup>225.</sup> The Coherent Duration of assets and liabilities is defined as changes in the value of assets and liabilities, in proportion to the total amount of assets exposed to interest rate risk, following parallel shocks raising and lowering interest rates by 10 basis points.

{708}------------------------------------------------

- ii. an overall net decrease of approximately €23.4 billion in the Poste Vita group's portfolio of *Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income* (a nominal value of the fixed income instruments of approximately €110 billion), almost entirely transferred to policyholders and recognised in specific technical provisions under the shadow accounting mechanism.
The sensitivity to the spread has been calculated by applying a shift of +/- 100 bps to the yield curve for Italian government bonds.

The table below shows the results of the analysis of sensitivity226 to spread risk of the most significant positions in the portfolios of both the Parent Company and the Poste Vita group at 31 December 2022.

For the purposes of full disclosure, a movement in the spread would have no accounting effect on financial assets measured at amortised cost, but would only impact unrealised gains and losses. In other words, fixed income instruments measured at amortised cost attributable entirely to BancoPosta, which at 31 December 2022 amounted to €27,699 million (nominal value of €28,304 million) and have a fair value of €23,651 million, would be reduced in fair value by approximately €2.45 billion following an increase in the spread of 100 bps, with the change not reflected in the accounts.

Movements in the spread have no impact on BancoPosta RFC's ability to meet its capital requirements, as the fair value reserves are not included in the computation of own funds for supervisory purposes.

<sup>226.</sup> For sensitivity purposes, the swap rate curve and the BTP curve were used (10-year swap rate of 320 bps and the spread of the BTP compared to the 10-year swap rate of 151 bps).

For the purposes of full disclosure, following an increase in the spread of 100 bps, the Poste Vita group's fixed income instruments measured at amortised cost, which at 31 December 2022 amounted to €2,159 million (notional value of €2,081 million) and have a fair value of €1,863 million, would be reduced in fair value by approximately €142 million, with the change not reflected in the accounts.

In addition to using the above sensitivity analysis, Poste Italiane SpA and the Poste Vita group monitor spread risk by calculating its maximum potential losses, through an estimate of Value at Risk (VAR) on statistical bases, over a 1-day time horizon and at a 99% confidence level. Risk analysis performed through VAR takes into account the historical variability of the risk (spread) in question, in addition to modelling parallel shifts of the yield curve.

The following table shows the maximum potential loss computed at 31 December 2022, limited, in terms of materiality, to the financial assets held by the Parent Company and the Poste Vita group.

# Cash flow interest rate risk

This is defined as the uncertainty related to the generation of future cash flows, due to interest rate fluctuations. It may result from the misalignment – in terms of interest rates, indexation methods and maturities – of financial assets and liabilities that tend to remain in place until their contractual and/or expected maturity (so-called banking book) which, as such, generate economic effects in terms of net interest income, reflecting on the income results of future periods.

The following analysis refers to the uncertainty over future cash flows generated by variable-rate instruments and variable-rate instruments created through fair value hedges following fluctuations in market interest rates.

Sensitivity to cash flow interest rate risk relating to these instruments is calculated by assuming a parallel shift in the yield curve of +/- 100 bps.

Sensitivity to cash flow interest rate risk at 31 December 2022 on the Poste Italiane Group's positions is shown in the table below.

Specifically, with respect to financial assets, the cash flow interest rate risk primarily relates to:

- z a portion of the securities portfolio held by Poste Vita SpA, with a total nominal value of €4,372 million;
- z receivables at amortised cost totalling €2,457 million, reflecting collateral posted to secure liabilities arising in relation to financial derivatives and repurchase agreements held by BancoPosta RFC;
- z investment by the Parent Company of the funds deriving from the current account deposits of Public Administration entities in the following: deposits with the MEF, with a nominal value of €11,907 million;
- z fixed rate government bonds held by the Parent Company at both variable rate for a nominal total of €500 million and fixed rate swapped into variable rate positions through fair value hedges, with a total nominal amount of €18,006 million (including €4,550 million in securities hedged against changes in fair value, where the hedges will begin to have an effect on profit or loss in the 12 months after the end of the period under review); in addition to an inflation-linked bond issued by the Italian Republic, with a nominal value of €150 million, both of which have been hedged against changes in its fair value.

In relation to cash and cash equivalents, cash flow interest rate risk primarily relates to the bank deposits of Poste Italiane SpA and Poste Vita SpA, in addition to amounts deposited by the Parent Company with the MEF and held in the so-called "buffer account".

{713}------------------------------------------------

This is the risk of default of one of the counterparties to which there is an exposure, with the exception of equities and units of mutual funds.

In order to comply with the provisions of IFRS 9, which requires the inclusion of a forward looking approach in the calculation of expected losses on financial instruments, also taking into account the evolution of the Italian economic scenario, the Group updated the forecast scenarios to take into account new elements based on the IMF's estimates for the year 2022, which led to a slight increase in the PD of Italy and the other Sovereign counterparties compared to what was used in the assessments of the Annual Financial Report at 31 December 2021.

## Credit risk management practices: inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques

Il The impairment model applicable to financial instruments measured at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income is based on Expected Credit Losses (ECL). Below, the methods adopted to manage credit risk are described.

## General description of the models utilised

The Group uses the general impairment model in accordance with risk ratings estimated on the basis of the type of counterparty:

- z Securities/deposits with Sovereign, Banking and Corporate counterparties: internal models for estimating risk parameters;
- z Public Administration and Central Counterparties: risk ratings deriving from agency ratings or average default rates for the sector.

The simplified approach is applied to trade receivables, as described in greater detail later.

## Significant increase in credit risk

Based on the impairment model adopted by the Poste Italiane Group to meet the requirements of the accounting standard, any significant increase in credit risk associated with the financial instruments held, other than trade receivables, is determined on the basis of a change in the relevant credit rating between the time of the initial investment and the reporting date.

This change in notches is compared with a threshold that takes into account the following factors:

- z the rating of the financial instrument at the time of investment;
- z the rating of the financial instrument at the reporting date;
- z the seniority of the position within the portfolio (vintage factor);
- z an additive factor to mitigate the non-linearity of PD with respect to the rating classes227;
- z a judgemental factor to be used only in the presence of sudden changes in the creditworthiness not yet reflected by the rating228.

The ratings used in stage allocation derive from internal models in the case of banking, sovereign and corporate counterparties, and external info providers in the case of Public Administration and Central Counterparties. Based on the above information, the Poste Italiane Group rebuts the presumption that there have been significant increases in credit risk following initial recognition, when financial assets are more than 30 days past due.

<sup>227.</sup> The additive factor is built in view of the rating level at the reporting date, where the better the final rating the higher the threshold for the transition to Stage 2.

<sup>228.</sup> The judgemental factor can summarise significant aspects in determining the significant increase of credit risk, considering such elements as:

<sup>•</sup> an actual or expected significant change of the internal/external credit rating of the financial instrument;

<sup>•</sup> actual or expected negative changes in economic, financial or business conditions that might cause a significant change in the borrower's ability to honour its obligations, such as an actual or expected increase in interest rates or an actual or expected significant increase in the unemployment rate.

{714}------------------------------------------------

The Poste Italiane Group decided not to adopt the Low Credit Risk Exemption and to proceed instead with stage allocation of the financial instruments concerned.

Regarding trade receivables, given the adoption of the simplified approach under the new accounting standard, expected credit losses are determined throughout the lifetime of the instrument.

## Definition of default

The Poste Italiane Group defines default on the basis of ad hoc assessments that take into account:

- z any payment delays;
- z market information such as a default rating by the rating agencies;
- z internal analyses of specific exposures.

## Collective and individual provisions

The collective impairment of a homogenous group of financial assets defines the expected credit loss (ECL) of the instrument, even though it cannot be associated with a specific exposure. Grouping takes place in relation to the type of counterparty on the basis of the estimated PD.

Individual provisions are considered only following the review of trade receivables for amounts in excess of a given threshold and only in relation to single receivables.

## Forward looking information

According to the standard, the ECL calculation must also factor in forward looking components based on broad consensus scenarios.

The Poste Italiane Group incorporates forward looking information directly in the PD estimation. In particular, for sovereign counterparties, for which authoritative forward-looking estimates are available, these values are used to calculate PD; for other counterparties, on the other hand, the internal model adopted allows the input dataset needed to calculate PD to be completed from scenario values referring to some of the model variables. The objective of the approach is to estimate the unknown variables by using the historical correlation of the available information229.

## Estimation techniques used

Since events of default cannot be used, as they are not very frequent, to develop credit scoring models for Sovereign, Banking and Corporate counterparties, a shadow rating approach has been adopted.

This method entails the use of target variables related to the level of external rating produced by the agencies. The target could be directly the rating or, alternatively, the default rate linked to the rating level.

A key rating agency was selected to construct the target, taking into account both the large number of rated counterparties and the availability of historical data over what was deemed to be an adequate period of time.

The models have been constructed by extracting and utilising the following types of data for each country in the sample:

- z macroeconomic data;
- z market data: domestic equity indices, global energy/non-energy indices, Eurostoxx and S&P 500;
- z financial statement data.

229. In particular, the use of such approach is limited to situations where, actually, the final data are deemed to be no longer representative of the counterparty's risk.

{715}------------------------------------------------

The internal model estimate used a definition of default based on the following approach:

- z Government financial instruments payment delays, including also for one day, or debt renegotiation;
- z Corporate and Banking financial instruments 90-day payment delays.

## ECL measurement

Expected credit losses (ECL) are determined over a time horizon consistent with the stage level (12 months or lifetime) on the basis of the following factors:

- z Probability di Default (PD);
- z Loss Given Default (LGD);
- z Exposure at Default (EAD);
- z Time Factor (TF).

The main assumptions/choices adopted in the determination of the factors are as follows:

- z PD: as indicated from the start, a Point in Time (PIT) and forward-looking evaluation has been adopted;
- z LGD: values have been used consistent with the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Base Approach under the Basel guidelines (45% for senior risk assets, 75% for subordinated risk assets);
- z EAD: exposure calculated prospectively until maturity of the instrument, starting from the development of projected cash flows. In the development account was taken of specific indexation assumptions for every asset class (fixed income securities, variable-rate securities, inflation-indexed securities, etc.);
- z TF: the effective interest rate of each exposure was used as discount factor.

## Trade receivables

The Group adopts the simplified approach to test for the impairment of trade receivables, on the basis of which provisions for credit losses are determined for an amount equal to expected losses throughout the lifetime of the receivable. Such approach is implemented through the following process:

- z based on total revenue or the historical credit exposure, all receivables or credit exposures exceeding a certain pre-established credit threshold are assessed analytically. The analytical evaluation of the exposures entails an analysis of the borrower's credit quality and solvency, as determined on the basis of internal and external supporting evidence;
- z for receivables falling below the threshold set, through the preparation of a matrix with the different impairment percentages estimated on the basis of historical losses, where they exist, or alternatively on the historical pattern of collections. In constructing the impairment matrix, receivables are grouped by homogeneous categories, based on their characteristics, to take into account the historical loss experience.

## Exposure to credit risk

With regard to the financial assets exposed to this risk and to which the accounting rules governing impairment apply, the following table shows the Poste Italiane Group's exposure at 31 December 2022, relating to financial assets measured at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, for which a general deterioration model was used. The analysis shows the exposure by financial asset class by stages. The amounts refer to the gross carrying amount (amortised cost before ECL), unless otherwise indicated, and do not take into account guarantees or other credit enhancements.

## Collateral held and other credit enhancements

## Principles and processes involved in measuring and managing guarantees and other credit risk mitigation instruments

The Poste Italiane Group uses instruments to mitigate credit risk and counterparty risk. Specifically:

- z as regards Poste Italiane SpA, primarily in relation to BancoPosta RFC, the counterparty risk associated with hedging derivatives and repurchase agreements is mitigated by entering into a master netting agreement and requiring collateral in the form of cash or government bonds; with reference to credit risk, in addition, there are safeguards such as government guarantees on securities;
- z the Poste Vita Group invests in, among other things, corporate bonds that are guaranteed in order to mitigate the overall exposure to credit risk;
- z in terms of trade receivables, the Poste Italiane Group credit terms are extended for customers, requesting, in certain cases, guarantees or sureties issued by prime banks or insurance companies.

{718}------------------------------------------------

At 31 December 2022, the Group does not hold financial assets secured by guarantees or other risk mitigation instruments for which no loss provisions have been made (except for the temporary use of liquidity in repurchase agreements).

The main types of instrument used to mitigate credit risk are described below.

Debt instruments held by the Group and secured by guarantees or other risk mitigation instruments are as follows:

- z bonds issued by CDP SpA guaranteed by the Italian State and subscribed by BancoPosta RFC, amounting to a nominal value of €3,000 million at 31 December 2022. These are recognised as financial assets measured at amortised cost and, in determining the associated expected credit losses, account was taken of the PD of the Italian Republic;
- z bonds held by the Poste Vita Group, amounting to a nominal value of €6,158 million at 31 December 2022. In these cases, the guarantee covers 100% of the nominal value of the securities. The guarantees securing these financial instruments are as follows:
	- corporate bonds backed by personal guarantees provided the Parent Company or another associate, amounting to a nominal value of €5,364 million;
	- covered bonds backed by mortgages, primarily property mortgages, amounting to a nominal value of €186 million;
	- bonds guaranteed by sovereign states, amounting to a nominal value of €608 million.

In the case of instruments backed by personal guarantees provided by a sovereign state or one or more companies, expected losses are calculated on the basis of the credit rating of the guarantor. With regard to covered bonds, the underlying guarantees were considered through the recognition of upgrades according to the type of guarantee.

## Derivative financial instruments and repurchase agreements

In order to limit the counterparty risk exposure, Poste Italiane SpA has concluded standard ISDA master agreements (with attached CSA) and GMRAs which govern the collateralization of derivative transactions and repurchase agreements, respectively.

In addition, in order to mitigate counterparty risk and gain easier access to the market, from December 2017, BancoPosta RFC has entered into repurchase agreements with the Central Counterparty, the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia. As of 2021, certain derivatives entered into by BancoPosta RFC through bilateral contracts will be routed to a Qualified Central Counterparty for centralised clearing through the services provided by a clearing broker.

The calculation of positions in derivatives and repurchase agreements and the related risk mitigation instruments are illustrated in the paragraph "Offsetting financial assets and liabilities".

## Trade receivables

To mitigate the risks arising from the extension of credit terms to its customers, the Poste Italiane Group has implemented a policy and suitable guidelines that govern the management of trade receivables, the terms and conditions of payment applicable to customers and defines the corporate process aimed at checking the customer's creditworthiness, as well as the sustainability of the business risk inherent in the contract involving extended payment terms.

Depending on the evaluations, the contracts entered into with customers may require a suitable guarantee. Guarantees are also requested if they are required by rules and regulations and/or implementing rules of specific services.

The Poste Italiane Group accepts mainly guarantees issued by primary banks or insurance companies. Alternatively, upon request of the customer and after a risk analysis, it accepts sureties issued by other institutions or security deposits through the opening of a postal escrow account.

The Poste Italiane Group, as a rule, exempts the Public Administration from the provision of guarantees to secure trade receivables arising from transactions with it, save for the cases when such guarantees are mandatory by law or due to implementing rules of specific services.

For all the exposures evaluated individually, to calculate the provisions for doubtful debts, guarantees reduce the amount of the exposure at risk.

At 31 December 2022, the provisions for doubtful debts due from customers included net releases of approximately €34 million mainly arising from agreements finalised during the year, as well as additions to appropriations in the 2023 State Budget for certain credit items subject over time to legislative measures restricting public spending, for further details see Note A8 - Trade Receivables. Net provisions of €51 million mainly refer to receivables subject to bankruptcy proceedings and receivables entrusted to the legal department for recovery. Utilisations for the year mainly refer to the write-off of receivables following the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings and agreements, and to the write-off of receivables for current accounts with a debtor balance, for which it was ascertained that recovery actions were not cost effective, also taking into account the small amount of the individual credit positions.

The provisions for doubtful debts due from the MEF reflect the absence of funds in the state budget, meaning it is not possible to collect certain amounts receivable, recognised on the basis of legislation or contracts and agreements in effect at the time of recognition.

In compliance with IFRS 7 – *Financial instruments: Disclosures*, this section provides details of financial assets and liabilities that are subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements, regardless of whether the financial instruments have been offset in keeping with paragraph 42 of IAS 32230.

In particular, the disclosures in question concern the following positions relating to Poste Italiane SpA at 31 December 2022:

- z derivative assets and liabilities and related collateral, represented both by cash and government securities;
- z repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and the related collateral, represented both by cash and government securities.

The positions in question are subject to standard bilateral netting agreements that allow, in the event of the counterparty's default, the offsetting of debit and credit positions covered by ISDA contracts and repurchase agreements, for which GMRA agreements have been entered into.

Repurchase agreement positions managed through the Central Counterparty that meet the requirements of IAS 32 are shown net of offsetting.

In order to present the tables in compliance with the requirements of IFRS 7, repurchase agreements are shown at amortised cost, whilst derivative transactions are shown at fair value; the relevant financial guarantees are measured at fair value.

<sup>230.</sup> Paragraph 42 of IAS 32 provides that "A financial asset and a financial liability can be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, an entity:

<sup>(</sup>a) currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and

<sup>(</sup>b) intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously".

# Liquidity risk

This is the risk that an entity may have difficulties in raising sufficient funds, at market conditions, to meet its obligations deriving from financial instruments.

In order to minimise this risk, the Poste Italiane Group applies a financial policy based on diversification of the various forms of short-term and long-term borrowings and counterparties; availability of relevant credit lines in terms of amounts and the number of banks; gradual and consistent distribution of the maturities of medium/long-term borrowings; and use of dedicated analytical models to monitor the maturities of assets and liabilities.

At 31 December 2022, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents amounted to €1.2 billion. The committed and uncommitted credit lines available to the Group and the related uses are summarised in the table below.

| Description<br>(€m)        | Balance at 31.12.2022 | Balance at 31.12.2021 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Committed credit lines     | 2,450                 | 1,750                 |
| Short-term loans           | 2,450                 | 1,750                 |
| Uncommitted credit lines   | 2,159                 | 2,357                 |
| Short-term loans           | 1,005                 | 1,309                 |

| Uncommitted uses           | 652                   | 975                   |
| Short-term loans           | 1                     | 550                   |
| Unsecured loans            | 652                   | 425                   |

At 31 December 2022, the Parent Company's unsecured loans amounted to €886 million.

No collateral has been provided to secure the credit lines obtained.

On 31 March 2022, a new loan of €100 million was signed with the EIB "Green Mobility". The loan, disbursed on 2 May 2022, provides interest at a fixed rate of 1.467% and matures on 2 May 2028.

The uncommitted credit lines are also available for overnight transactions entered into by BancoPosta RFC.

In addition, from 26 June 2020, BancoPosta RFC may access a 3-year committed facility granted by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti for repurchase agreements up to a maximum of €4.25 billion, unused at 31 December 2022.

Finally, the Bank of Italy has granted BancoPosta RFC access to intraday credit in order to fund intraday interbank transactions. Collateral for this credit facility is provided by securities with a nominal value of €2,582 million, and the facility is unused at 31 December 2022.

At 31 December 2022, the Parent Company had an EMTN - Euro Medium Term Note program of €2.5 billion in place, thanks to which the Group can raise an additional €1.45 billion on the capital market. As part of this programme, in 2013, Poste Italiane placed a 10-year loan of €50 million on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and in December 2020, it placed an additional senior unsecured loan with a total nominal value of €1 billion.

The existing credit lines and the loans are adequate to meet financing requirements expected to date.

The following tables compare the Poste Italiane Group's liabilities and assets at 31 December 2022.

In the case of assets, cash inflows are broken down by maturity, shown at nominal value and increased, where applicable, by interest receivable. Held-to-maturity and available-for-sale financial assets include financial instruments held by BancoPosta RFC and the Group's insurance companies, shown on the basis of expected cash flows, consisting of principal and interest paid at the various payment dates.

The key point of note is the liquidity risk associated with the investment of customers' current account balances and with the Class I and V policies issued by Poste Vita SpA.

In terms of BancoPosta RFC's specific operations, the liquidity risk regards current account deposits and prepaid cards231, the related investment of the deposits in Eurozone government securities and/or securities guaranteed by the Italian government, and the margins on derivative transactions as well as tax credits acquired in relation to the "*Decreto Rilancio*" no. 34/2020 (later converted with Law no. 77 of 17 July 2020). The potential risk derives from a mismatch between the maturities of investments in securities and those of liabilities, represented by current accounts where the funds are available on demand, thus compromising the ability to meet its obligations to current account holders. This potential mismatch between assets and liabilities is monitored

<sup>231.</sup> Since 1 October 2018, prepaid cards are the responsibility of PostePay SpA. The liquidity raised through these cards is transferred to BancoPosta, which invests the funds raised in euro area government bonds or bonds guaranteed by the Italian State. As such, for the purposes of specific risk analyses, the rationales related to each model underlying the different types of deposit inflow continue to apply.

{725}------------------------------------------------

via comparison of the maturity schedule for assets with the statistical model of the performance of current account deposits, in accordance with the various likely maturity schedules and assuming the progressive total withdrawal of deposits over a period of twenty years for retail customers, ten years for business customers and Postepay cards and five years for Public Administration customers.

As to the policies sold by Poste Vita SpA, in order to analyse its liquidity risk profile, the company performs Asset/liability management (ALM) analysis to manage assets effectively in relation to its obligations to policyholders, and also develops projections of the effects deriving from financial market shocks (asset dynamics) and of the behaviour of policyholders (liability dynamics).

Lastly, for the proper evaluation of the liquidity risk attributable to BancoPosta RFC, it should be borne in mind that, unless they are restricted, investments in euro area government securities are highly liquid assets and can be used as collateral in interbank repurchase agreements to obtain short-term financing. This practice is normally adopted by BancoPosta.

## Price risk

This is the risk that the value of a financial instrument fluctuates as a result of market price movements, deriving from factors specific to the individual instrument or the issuer, and factors that influence all instruments traded on the market.

Price risk relates to financial assets classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI") or measured at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"), and certain derivative financial instruments where changes in value are recognised in profit or loss.

The sensitivity analysis at 31 December 2022 took into account positions potentially exposed to fluctuations in value. Financial statement balances have been subjected to a stress test, based on actual volatility during the year, considered to be representative of potential market movements. The results of the sensitivity analysis carried out at 31 December 2022 for the Poste Italiane Group are shown in the following table.

## Foreign exchange risk

This is the risk that the value of a financial instrument fluctuates as a result of movements in exchange rates for currencies other than the functional currency.

Sensitivity analysis of the items subject to foreign exchange risk was based on the most significant positions, assuming a stress scenario determined by the levels of exchange rate volatility applicable to each foreign currency position. The test applies an exchange rate movement based on volatility during the year, which was considered to be representative of potential market movements.

The table below shows the sensitivity to foreign exchange risk of the Poste Italiane Group's most significant positions at 31 December 2022.

# Other risks

The other principal risks to which the Poste Italiane Group is exposed at 31 December 2022 are described below.

# Operational risk

Operational risk refers to the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. This category of risk includes losses resulting from fraud, human error, business disruption, systems failures, breach of contracts and natural disasters. Operational risk includes legal risk.

To protect against this form of risk, BancoPosta RFC has formalised a methodological and organisational framework to identify, measure and manage the operational risk related to its products/processes.

The framework, which is based on an integrated (qualitative and quantitative) measurement model, makes it possible to monitor and manage risk on an increasingly informed basis.

In 2022, activities continued to refine the operational risk management framework, with the aim of making the process of recording operational losses, monitoring and reporting more efficient and mitigating such risks by cross-functional working groups. Support has also been provided to the specialist units and the owner of the process of analysing and assessing IT risk, in keeping with the approach adopted in 2021, and the monitoring of IT risk recovery plans was reinforced.

The activities carried out in 2022 also included assessments of the risk profile related to the assignment and outsourcing of BP RFC, the definition of the model for monitoring outsourcing risk, and ex-ante assessments of the risk profile related to the innovation of BP's offering and/or specific project initiatives.

At 31 December 2022, the risk map prepared in accordance with the aforementioned framework shows the type of operational risks BancoPosta RFC's products are exposed to. In particular:

| Event type                                 | Number of types |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Internal fraud                             | 29              |
| External fraud                             | 40              |
| Employee practices and workplace safety    | 7               |
| Customers, products and business practices | 36              |
| Damage caused by external events           | 4               |
| Business disruption and system failure     | 8               |
| Execution, delivery and process management | 98              |
| Total at 31 December 2022                  | 222             |

For each type of mapped risk, the related sources of risk (internal losses, external losses, scenario analysis and risk indicators) have been recorded and classified in order to construct complete inputs for the integrated measurement model. Systematic measurement of the mapped risks has enabled the prioritization of mitigation initiatives and the attribution of responsibilities in order to contain any future impact.

Poste Vita SpA and Poste Assicura SpA have also drawn up and finalised their own framework for identifying, assessing and managing operational risks. The adopted approach reflects the specific nature of the processes and operational risk events typical of an insurance company. The process of assessing operational risk exposure is carried out in keeping with the related solvency requirements, and involves both qualitative and quantitative analysis, conducted through a structured process for identifying internal losses and assessing potential risks in terms of frequency, impact and mitigation. The exposure to risks is, on the whole, in line with the previous year, and the main types of operating losses are related to customer litigation expenses.

{744}------------------------------------------------

# Other operational risks

In the exercise of its new energy business, PostePay is exposed to various risks, which are appropriately mitigated through physical purchases of commodities at a fixed price or through physical purchases at a spot price with the addition of derivative financial instruments (Commodity Swaps/Futures) and through forecasting activities of sales volumes and pricing of these risks.

# Insurance risks

Insurance risks derive from the stipulation of insurance contracts and the terms and conditions contained therein (technical bases adopted, premium calculation, terms and conditions of cash surrender, etc.). Mortality, longevity and redemption risks are relevant here.

In technical terms, mortality is one of the main risk factors for Poste Vita SpA, i.e. any risk associated with the uncertainty of a policyholder's life expectancy. Particular attention is paid in selling pure life insurance policies, an area where procedures set underwriting limits to the capital and the age of the policyholder. In terms of "pure life" insured amounts the Group's insurance companies transfer their risks to reinsurers in keeping with the nature of the products sold and conservation levels adequate to the companies' capital structure.

For products with the capital sum subject to positive risk, such as term life insurance, this risk has negative consequences if the actual frequency of death exceeds the death probabilities realistically calculated (second order technical bases).

For products with the capital sum subject to negative risk, such as annuities, there are negative consequences when actual death frequencies are lower than the death probabilities realistically calculated (longevity risk).

Nevertheless, at 31 December 2022, the mortality risk is limited for the Group, considering the features of the products offered. The only area where this risk is somewhat significant is term life insurance. With reference to these products, a comparison is periodically made between actual deaths and those predicted by the demographic bases adopted for pricing. Moreover, mortality risk is mitigated through reinsurance and by setting limits on both the capital and the age of the policyholder when policies are sold.

Longevity risk is also low. In fact, for most life insurance products the probability of annuitisation is very close to zero, as historical experience shows that policyholders never use the option to annuitise. Pension products, in particular, still account for a limited share of insurance liabilities. In addition, for these products, the Group may, if certain conditions materialise, change the demographic base and the composition by sex used to calculate the annuity rates.

Pricing risk is the risk of incurring losses due to inadequate premiums charged for the insurance products sold. It may arise due to:

- z inappropriate selection of the technical basis;
- z incorrect assessment of the options embedded in the product;
- z incorrect evaluation of the factors used to calculate the expense loads.

As Poste Vita's mixed and whole-life policies have mostly cash value build-up features, accumulating in accordance with a technical rate of zero, the technical basis adopted does not affect premium calculation (and/or the insured capital). In fact, there is nearly no pricing risk associated with the choice between technical bases in Poste Vita's portfolio, except for the term life insurance products discussed above.

The options embedded in the policies held in the portfolio include:

- z Surrender option;
- z Guaranteed minimum return option;
- z Annuity conversion option.

For nearly all the products in the portfolio there are no surrender penalties: the surrender risk only becomes significant, however, in the event of mass surrenders which, on the basis of historical evidence, have a low probability of occurrence (a surrender rate of approximately 3.1% in 2022).

{745}------------------------------------------------

Poste Assicura SpA is exposed to the following insurance risks:

- z Underwriting risk: the risk deriving from the conclusion of insurance contracts associated with the events insured, the processes followed when pricing and selecting risks and unfavourable claims trends compared with previous estimates. This risk can be divided into the following categories:
	- Pricing risk: the risk linked to the company's pricing of its policies which depends on the assumptions used in order to calculate premiums. If prices are based on inadequate assumptions, the insurer may be exposed to the risk of being unable to meet its contractual obligations to policyholders. These risks include those related to disability-morbidity, or the risk associated with the payment of benefits or claims for illness and/or injury. Also included in this category is the risk that the loadings applied to premiums are insufficient to support the actual expenses incurred in managing the contract.
	- Provisioning risk: referring to the risk that technical provisions are not sufficient to meet obligations to policyholders. This insufficiency may be due to incorrect estimates by the company and/or changes in the general environment.
- z Catastrophe risk: represents the risk of loss resulting from extreme or exceptional events, including major epidemics covered by insurance.
- z Early termination risks: risk linked to the possibility of the policyholder's early termination of the contract with the consequent request for reimbursement of the premium.

As regards Poste Assicura SpA's insurance business, the expected growth of the portfolio and the different degrees of risk associated with the products distributed has required the company to adopt a highly prudent approach to reinsurance.

The reinsurance strategy, based mainly on a non-proportional approach, makes it possible to:

- z mitigate unfavourable technical trends and risks arising from peak exposures;
- z optimise reinsurance structures with a view to risk transfer and, if possible, also improve overall costs in economic and capital allocation terms;
- z make reinsurance structures more efficient from a management point of view;
- z mitigate risks, stabilising the variability of insurance business results.

In particular, reinsurance treaties with market operators of primary standing were entered into with non-proportional coverage in the form of "excess loss" (per risk and per event), separately for the various classes, to cover all Poste Assicura's risks (Retail and Employee Benefits) such as: risks included in the accident, health, fire, general liability and other property damage classes, and "catastrophic risks" such as earthquake or pandemic. The treaties signed in the start-up phase of the company on a proportional basis, on a risk attaching basis, for certain risks such as income protection insurance and credit protection remain in place in runoff. In addition, legal expenses risks are managed under a quota share treaty. Lastly, for all risks that do not meet the qualitative and quantitative criteria provided for in existing reinsurance treaties, but which however fall within Poste Assicura underwriting philosophy, use is made of optional reinsurance.

Poste Assicura defines, on a case-by-case basis, the share of risk and the reinsurance structure deemed most appropriate in relation to the characteristics of the risk in question.

With reference to P&C risks, the Group performs specific analyses including, among other things, stress tests to determine the Company's solvency also under adverse market conditions.

# Reputational risk

The main element of reputational risk to which the Group is, by its nature, exposed is linked to market performance and primarily associated with the placement of postal savings products and investment products issued by third-party entities (bonds, certificates and real estate funds) or by Group companies (insurance policies issued by the subsidiary, Poste Vita SpA, and mutual funds managed by BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR).

# 7. Fair value of financial instruments

# 7.1 Fair value measurement techniques

The Poste Italiane Group has adopted a fair value policy, setting out the general principles and rules to be applied in determining fair value for the purposes of preparing the financial statements, conducting risk management assessments and supporting the market transactions carried out by the Finance departments of the various Group entities. The general principles for measuring financial instruments at fair value have not changed since 31 December 2021, except for appropriate additions to include models to support the fair value measurement of loans acquired with reference to Law no. 77/2020 described below. These general principles have been identified in compliance with the indications from the reference accounting standards and from the various Regulators (banking and insurance), ensuring uniformity in the valuation techniques adopted within the Group. The methods used have been revised, where necessary, to take into account developments in operational procedures and in market practices during the year.

In compliance with IFRS 13 - *Fair Value Measurement*, the following section provides information regarding the techniques used to measure the fair value of financial instruments within the Poste Italiane Group.

The assets and liabilities concerned (specifically assets and liabilities measured at fair value and measured at cost or amortised cost, for which fair value is required to be disclosed in the notes) are classified with reference to a hierarchy that reflects the materiality of the sources used for their valuation.

The hierarchy consists of 3 levels.

Level 1: this level is comprised of fair values determined with reference to unadjusted prices quoted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which the entity has access on the measurement date. For the Poste Italiane Group the following categories of financial instrument apply:

#### Bonds quoted on active markets:

- z Bonds issued by EU government bodies or Italian or foreign corporate bonds: measurement is based on bid prices, according to a hierarchy of sources where the MTS (the wholesale electronic market for government securities) ranks first, MILA (Milan Stock Exchange) second, for bonds intended for retail customers, and the CBBT (Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader) third;
- z Financial liabilities: measurement is based on the ask prices quoted by CBBT (Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader).

Equity securities and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) listed on active markets: the valuation is made considering the price resulting from the last contract traded on the day on the relevant stock exchange.

Quoted open-end investment funds: measurement is based on the daily closing market price as provided by Bloomberg or the fund manager. Level 1 bond price quotations incorporate a credit risk component. Exchange rates published by the European Central Bank are used in determining the value of financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the euro.

Level 2: this level is comprised of fair values based on inputs other than Level 1 quoted market prices that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability233. For the Poste Italiane Group the following categories of financial instrument apply:

#### Bonds either quoted on inactive markets or not at all:

- z Straight Italian and international government and non-government bonds: valuation is based on discounted cash flow techniques involving the computation of the present value of future cash flows, inputting rates from yield curves incorporating
<sup>233.</sup> Given the nature of Poste Italiane Group's operations, the observable data used as input to determine the fair value of the various instruments include, for example, quoted prices provided by third parties (pricing or brokerage services), yield and inflation curves, exchange rates provided by the European Central Bank, ranges of rate volatility, inflation option premiums, interest rate swap spreads or credit default spreads which represent the creditworthiness of specific counterparties and any liquidity adjustments quoted by primary market counterparties.

{747}------------------------------------------------

spreads reflecting credit risk that are based on spreads determined with reference to quoted and liquid benchmark securities issued by the issuer, or by other companies with similar characteristics to the issuer. Yield curves may be slightly adjusted to reflect liquidity risk relating to the absence of an active market.

- z Structured bonds: valuation is based on a building block approach, entailing decomposition of a structured position into its basic components: the bond and option components. The bond component is measured by discounting cash flows to present value in line with the approach applicable to straight bonds, as defined above. The option component - which considering the features of the bonds included in the portfolio of the Poste Italiane Group relates to interest rate risk - is measured in accordance with a standard closed form expression as with classical option valuation models with underlyings exposed to such risks.
Unquoted equities: this category may be included here provided it is possible to use the price of quoted equities of the same issuer as a benchmark. The price inferred in this manner would be adjusted through the application of the discount implicit in the process to align the value of the unquoted shares to the quoted ones.

Unquoted open-end investment funds: measurement is based on the latest available NAV (Net Asset Value) as provided by Bloomberg or as determined by the fund manager.

#### Derivative financial instruments:

### z Interest Rate Swaps:

Plain vanilla interest rate swaps: valued using discounted cash flow techniques, involving the computation of the present value of future differentials between the receiver and payer legs of the swap. The construction of yield curves to estimate future cash flows indexed to market parameters (money market rates and/or inflation) and computation of the present value of future differentials are carried out using techniques commonly used in capital markets.

Interest rate swaps with an embedded option: valuation is based on a building block approach, entailing decomposition of a structured position into its basic components: the linear and option components. The linear component is measured using the discounted cash flow techniques described for plain vanilla interest rate swaps above. Using the derivatives held in Poste Italiane's portfolio as an example, the option component is derived from interest rate or inflation rate risks and is valued using a closed form expression, as with classical option valuation models with underlyings exposed to such risks.

- z Bond forwards: valuation is based on the present value of the differential between the forward price of the underlying instrument as of the measurement date and the settlement price.
- z Warrants: considering the features of the securities held, measurement is based on the equity local volatility model. In particular, considering that buyback agreements have been entered into with the counterparties that structured these warrants, and that such counterparties use valuation models consistent with those used by the Group, these instruments are measured on the basis of the bid price quoted by the counterparties.
- z Currency forwards: valuation is based on the differential between the reciprocal currency registered at the measurement date and the reciprocal currency fixed at the trade date.

The derivatives held in Poste Italiane's portfolio may be pledged as collateral and the fair value, consequently, need not be adjusted for counterparty risk. The yield curve used to compute present value is selected to be consistent with the manner in which cash collateral is remunerated. This approach is also followed for security in the form of pledged debt securities, given the limited level of credit risk inherent in the securities held as collateral by the Poste Italiane Group.

In the rare instances where collateral agreements do not substantially reduce counterparty risk, measurement takes place by discounting to present value the cash flows generated by the securities held as collateral, using as the input a yield curve that reflects the spread applicable to the issuer's credit risk. Alternatively, use is made of fair value to calculate the CVA/DVA (Credit Valuation Adjustment/Debit Valuation Adjustment), in relation to the main technical and financial characteristics of the agreements and the counterparty's probability of default.

Reverse Repos: are valued using discounted cash flow techniques involving the computation of future contractual cash flows. These instruments may also be used for collateral and in such cases fair value need not be adjusted for the counterparty's credit risk.

Fixed-rate and variable-rate instruments: measurement is based on discounted cash flow. The counterparty's credit spread is considered through:

- z use of the Italian government yield curve or the credit default swap (CDS) of the Italian Republic, in the case of Italian government agencies;
- z use of quoted CDS yield curves or, if not available, the adoption of "synthetic" CDS yield curves represented by the counterparty's rating, as constructed starting from the input data observable on the market;

{748}------------------------------------------------

- z use of yield curves based on the specific issuer's quoted bond prices.
#### Financial liabilities either quoted on inactive markets or not at all:

- z Straight bonds: these are measured by discounting their future cash flows using as input a yield curve reflecting the spread applicable to the issuer's credit risk;
- z Structured bonds: valuation is based on a building block approach, entailing decomposition of a structured position into its basic components: the bond and option components. The bond component is measured by discounting cash flows to present value in line with the approach applicable to straight bonds, as defined above. The option component attributable to interest rate risk which, considering the features of the bonds issued by companies in the Poste Italiane Group, is measured in accordance with a standard closed form expression as with classical option valuation models with underlyings exposed to such risks.
- z Borrowings: these are measured by discounting their future cash flows using as input a yield curve reflecting the spread applicable to the credit risk.
- z Repurchase agreements: are valued using discounted cash flow techniques involving the computation of future contractual cash flows. Repos may also be used for collateral and in such cases fair value need not be adjusted for the counterparty's credit risk.

Level 3: this category includes the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities using inputs which cannot be observed, in addition to Level 2 inputs. For the Poste Italiane Group the following categories of financial instrument apply:

Fixed-rate and variable-rate loans: the measurement is carried out using discounted cash flow techniques. The counterparty's credit spread is set according to best practices, by using the probability of default and transition matrices created by external information providers and loss given default parameters determined by prudential regulations for banks or in accordance with market standards.

Closed-end unquoted funds: these include funds that invest mainly in unquoted instruments. Their fair value is determined by considering the latest NAV (Net Asset Value), available at least every six months, reported by the fund manager. This NAV is adjusted according to the capital calls and reimbursements announced by the managers which occurred between the latest NAV date and the valuation date.

Investment property (excluding former service accommodation) and inventories of properties held for sale: The fair value of both investment property and inventories has been determined mainly by discounting to present value the cash flows expected to be generated by the rental agreements and/or proceeds from sales, net of related costs. The process uses a discount rate that considers analytically the risks typical of the property.

Investment property (former service accommodation): The value of this investment property is determined on the basis of the applicable law (Law 560 of 24 December 1993), which sets the selling price in case of sale to the tenant or the minimum selling price if the property is sold through a public auction.

- z Unquoted equity instruments: this category includes shares for which no price is observable directly or indirectly in the market. For these types of instruments, fair value is determined by considering the implicit valuation at the time of acquisition, adjusted by value adjustments to take account of any changes in price resulting from significant transactions234 observable on the market in the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Alternatively, and in the absence of significant transactions, the fair value of the share is determined using alternative methods (verification of financial data that can be inferred from the company's Business Plans if available and analysis of the company's performance, multiple market use, etc.).
- z Tax credits Law no. 77/2020: this category includes credits acquired with reference to the "*Decreto Rilancio*" no. 34/2020 (later converted into Law no. 77 of 17 July 2020) for which no directly or indirectly observable market prices are available. For this type of instrument, the method of determining fair value involves the application of the discounted cash flow valuation technique, which consists of discounting cash flows to maturity using the yield curve constructed by adding to the risk-free rate curve the extra yield calculated starting from the price at the date of purchase of the receivables. The spread remains fixed for the life of the instrument.

<sup>234.</sup> A significant transaction in this context is defined as a minimum investment of €10 million or at least 5% of the share capital of the investee entity over the last twelve months from the reporting date.

Financial instruments classified in level 3 are held primarily by Poste Vita SpA and, to a residual extent, by Poste Italiane SpA and PostePay SpA.

In the case of the Group's insurance company, instruments in level 3 regard funds that invest primarily in unlisted instruments, whose fair value measurement is based on the latest available NAV (Net Asset Value) as announced by the fund manager. This NAV is adjusted according to the capital calls and reimbursements announced by the managers and occurring between the latest NAV date and the measurement date.

These financial instruments primarily consist of investments in private equity, private debt and real estate funds fully hedging Class I products related to separately managed accounts and investments linked to Class III products.

Changes during the period mainly concern the purchase of new investments, redemptions of unquoted closed-end fund units and the transfer of Class III funds from Level 3 to Level 2.

In order to acknowledge the observations made by the inspection report delivered on 26 July 2021 and in accordance with the related Share Plan, including the related additions, the Group Company adopted Guidelines supplementing the aforementioned Fair Value policy in order to regulate even more precisely the determination of fair value and the related price controls on the financial instruments in the Company's portfolio, with particular regard to the funds category.

That being said, also in order to take into account the provisions of the letter to the Market published by IVASS on 14 July 2021, it should be noted that at 31 December 2022, the allocation of the fair value levels of financial instruments was carried out using a prudential approach, taking into account the implementations still in progress necessary to carry out the "Full look through approach" on all categories of funds held in the Company's portfolio. To this end, it should be noted that the Company reclassified from fair value Level 3 to Level 2 about €3.6 billion referring almost exclusively to class III funds.

Finally, with regard to the Parent Company, following the conversion on 29 July 2022 of part of the Visa Series C shares into Visa Series A Preferred Stock, about 18 million of the C shares were reclassified from Level 3 to Level 2.

# 8. Hedging transactions

Below is a description of the hedging transactions entered into by the Poste Italiane Group, as distinguished between fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, which are accounted for as per IAS 39 – *Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement*. The fair value hedges and cash flow hedges described below refer mainly to fixed income securities or inflation-linked securities in relation to BancoPosta operations.

# Hedging transactions – Fair value hedges

# Hedging transactions on fixed-income and inflation-linked government bonds

The Poste Italiane Group has a government bond portfolio235 – made up of fixed-rate BTPs and inflation-linked BTPs – subject to movements in fair value due to changes in interest rates and in the inflation rate.

To limit the effects of interest rates on fair value, BancoPosta RFC enters into Over the Counter (OTC) interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of the bonds held in the portfolio. The objective of these transactions is to have instruments that can offset changes in fair value of the portfolio due to interest rate fluctuations and the rate of inflation. The credit risk of the Italian Republic is not hedged and is set for the duration of the swap.

Full hedges and partial hedges are implemented, with the start date equal to the date of purchase of the instrument (swap spot start) and after the purchase of the instrument (swap forward start), respectively.

The Group evaluates the effectiveness of every hedging relationship in offsetting movements in fair value through a retrospective effectiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test236, using the approaches illustrated in the following notes.

The retrospective effectiveness test is run by utilising the "dollar offset approach through the hypothetical derivative237". With this approach, consideration is given to the hedge ratio of the change in fair value of the actual derivative to the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative occurred between inception and the valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%. The hypothetical derivative and the actual hedging instrument have a settlement date consistent with the hedge inception (spot or forward start) and differ solely in their spread which is considered, as already indicated, the main source of ineffectiveness238. The partial ineffectiveness of the hedge, equal to the difference between the changes in value of the two derivatives (hypothetical and actual) represents the net effect of the hedge recognised separately in profit or loss.

<sup>235.</sup> As of the last quarter of 2022, BancoPosta also holds German and French government bonds in its portfolio that are not currently hedged. 236. IAS 39 requires two effectiveness tests:

<sup>•</sup> prospective effectiveness test: attests that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in future periods;

<sup>•</sup> retrospective effectiveness test: attests that the hedging relationship has been effective from inception to the reporting date.

For a hedge to be effective, the prospective effectiveness test must show that the hedge is highly effective in offsetting fair value or cash flow movements attributable to the hedged instrument during the designation period, while the result of the retrospective test must show offset ratios ranging from 80% to 125%.

A hedge can be ineffective when the hedging instrument and the hedged item: are in different currencies; have different maturities; use different underlying interest rates; are exposed to different counterparty risks; and when the derivative is not equal to zero at inception.

<sup>237.</sup> The dollar offset approach is a quantitative method that involves a comparison between movements in the fair value or cash flow of the hedging instrument and the movements in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged instrument attributable to the risk hedged. Depending on the policy selected, this approach can be used: • on a cumulative basis, by observing the performance of the hedge since inception;

<sup>•</sup> on a periodic basis, by comparing the hedge performance with that of the last test.

The dollar offset approach can be implemented through a hypothetical derivative, that is by constructing a theoretical derivative to compare the relevant theoretical movements in far value or cash flow with those of the hedged instrument (actual derivative).

<sup>238.</sup> For the hypothetical derivative use is made of the mid-market spread, which makes the present value at the settlement date equal to 0, and for the actual derivative the interest rate agreed upon with the counterparty.

{754}------------------------------------------------

For the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, different approaches have been adopted, depending on the characteristics of the hedging instrument. Specifically:

- z the "Critical terms239" approach for swap spot start, for which it has been determined at inception that the characteristics of the fixed leg make it possible to replicate exactly the fixed cash flows generated by the hedged item;
- z the "Dollar offset through the hypothetical derivative" approach for forward start swaps and forward sales of the subsidiary Poste Vita, for which the prospective effectiveness test is performed by calculating the hedge ratio between the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the change in fair value of the actual derivative240. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%.

With respect to the Poste Vita Group, forward sales expired in 2021 and were entered into in order to preserve, following unexpected changes in interest rates and/or credit risk, unrealised gains on government bonds of the Separately Managed Account Posta ValorePiù. The maturity of these positions was set to take into account the mismatch of cash flows between the portfolio of financial assets and liabilities.

## Hedging on repurchase agreements

The Poste Italiane Group carries out transactions in repurchase agreements, on euro-government securities or with the guarantee of the Italian state for various purposes, including to invest in government bonds, to meet liquidity needs arising from the dynamics of funding on current accounts, to actively manage the treasury position and to manage deposits as collateral for collateralisation transactions. These transactions are mainly fixed-rate transactions and are therefore exposed to changes in fair value due to fluctuations in interest rates.

To limit the effects of interest rates on fair value, the Group enters into Over the Counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (fair value hedges) designated as specific hedges of repurchase agreements in the portfolio.

The Group evaluates the effectiveness of every hedging relationship in offsetting movements in fair value through a retrospective effectiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test, using the approaches illustrated in the following notes.

The retrospective effectiveness test is run by utilising the "dollar offset approach through the hypothetical derivative". With this approach, consideration is given to the hedge ratio of the change in fair value of the actual derivative to the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative occurred between inception and the valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%. The hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative have a settlement date consistent with the hedge inception and differ solely in their fixed rate component which is considered the main source of ineffectiveness241. The partial ineffectiveness of the hedge, equal to the difference between the changes in value of the two derivatives (hypothetical and actual) represents the net effect of the hedge recognised separately in profit or loss.

For the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, the Group adopts the "dollar offset approach through the hypothetical derivative", performed by calculating the hedge ratio between the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the change in fair value of the actual derivative242. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%.

<sup>239.</sup> The critical terms approach involves a comparison between the critical terms of the hedging instrument with those of the hedged item. The hedging relationship is highly effective when all the critical terms of the two instruments match perfectly and there are no features or options that might invalidate the hedge. Critical terms include, for example: notional amount of the derivative and principal of the underlying, credit risk, timing, currency of the cash flows.

<sup>240.</sup> Calculated by assuming a parallel shift of +/- 100 bps of the yield curves.

<sup>241.</sup> Hedging is performed by defining the variable-rate component simply linked to the Euribor and the fixed-rate component incorporating market conditions. The hypothetical derivative uses the fixed rate at the market mid which makes the present value at the settlement date equal to 0, while the actual derivative uses the rate agreed upon with the counterparty.

<sup>242.</sup> Calculated by assuming a parallel shift of +/- 100 bps of the yield curves.

{755}------------------------------------------------

# Hedging transactions – Cash flow hedges

# Hedging transactions on inflation-linked government bonds and forecast transactions

To limit the exposure to interest rate risk deriving from the need to reinvest the cash generated by maturing bonds held in portfolio, BancoPosta RFC enters, if necessary, into forward purchases. In addition, to pursue the stabilisation of returns, forward sales are entered into. These derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions.

In addition, the Group has a portfolio of inflation-linked BTPs subject to cash flow variability in relation to inflation.

To limit the effects of interest rates on cash flows, the Group enters into OTC interest rate swaps or inflation swaps to hedge the cash flows of the bonds held in portfolio. The objective of these transactions is to stabilise until maturity the return of the instrument, regardless of movements of the variable parameter.

The Group evaluates the effectiveness of the designated derivative in every hedging relationship through a retrospective effectiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test.

With regards to the hedges of forecast transactions, the retrospective effectiveness test involves the calculation of a hedge ratio defined as the ratio of the difference between the fair value of the forward transaction entered into with the counterparty on the test and inception date and the present value of the difference between the theoretical forward price of the BTP calculated as of the test and inception date. Assuming a perfect match between the forward prices of the counterparties and the theoretical forward prices, the hedge ratio is always equal to 100%. As such, there are no sources of ineffectiveness.

For the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, the critical terms approach is applied, considering at inception the consistency between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the basis of the qualitative characteristics of the contracts243.

With respect to inflation-linked bonds, the retrospective effectiveness test considers the hedge ratio between the change in fair value of the actual derivative to the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative occurred between the date of inception and the valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%.

The hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative have the settlement date that matches the inception of the hedge and differ in terms of their fixed income component244. Moreover, for the derivatives used to hedge inflation-linked BTP, the fair value at the settlement date reflects also the interest accrued of the instrument accrued from the latest interest payment date to the date of settlement of the derivative. As such, both are considered the main sources of ineffectiveness.

The change in fair value of the actual derivative is recognised through equity, for the effective portion of the hedge, while the change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognised through profit or loss.

For the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, different approaches have been applied, depending on the characteristics of the hedging swap. Specifically:

- z the "Critical terms" approach for derivatives for which it has been determined at inception that the characteristics of the indexed leg of the swap make it possible to replicate exactly the variable cash flows generated by the hedged item;
- z the "Dollar offset through the hypothetical derivative" approach for derivative contracts with a fixed rate applicable to a nominal amount growing constantly at six-month intervals until the derivative expires. For these contracts the prospective effectiveness test is performed by calculating the hedge ratio between the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the change in fair value of the actual derivative245. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%.

<sup>243.</sup> The notional amount of the forward contract must be set, at the settlement date, as equal to the nominal amount of the instrument in case of purchase, and equal or lower than the nominal amount of the instrument in case of sale. The underlying of the forward contract must coincide with the instrument that must be purchased or sold (in this case it must be an instrument in the portfolio) at the settlement date. The settlement date must be the same as the date on which the cash flow to be hedged is expected, in case of forward purchase, or must be related to the year in which the total return must be stabilised, in case of forward sale.

<sup>244.</sup> The hypothetical derivative uses the fixed rate, which makes the present value at the settlement date equal to 0, while the actual derivative uses the interest rate agreed upon with the counterparty.

<sup>245.</sup> Calculated by assuming a parallel shift of +/- 100 bps of the yield curves.

{756}------------------------------------------------

# Variable rate bond hedges

The Poste Italiane Group is exposed to the risk of cash flow volatility in relation to the €50 million bond issue of 25 October 2013, which calls for annual variable interest payments.

The exposure to this risk is hedged through an interest rate swap to hedge cash flows whereby the Parent Company took on the obligation to pay a fixed rate and sold the variable interest payable by the bond. The hedge covers the interest rate risk while the implicit credit risk is not hedged.

The effectiveness of the hedges is tested retrospectively and prospectively by using the "Dollar offset through the hypothetical derivative" approach.

# Effects of hedging transactions on profit or loss and financial position

The table below shows the hedging instruments by expiration date. The average interest rate of the interest rate swaps shown represents the contractually expected average fixed rate of the hedging transaction by maturity band.

# Reform of reference indices for determining interest rates

The reform of key interest rate benchmarks, called the "InterBank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform", involved regulators in various jurisdictions around the world with the aim of replacing some interbank rates with risk-free alternative rates and preparing guidelines to update contract models.

Currently, the main benchmarks for the euro area are:

- z the Euro Short Term Rate ESTR (administered by the European Central Bank and published as of 2 October 2019) which replaced the Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA - no longer listed as of 1 January 2022) redefining it as ESTR plus 8.5 bps;
- z the EURIBOR (administered by the European Money Market Institute), whose reform process ended in November 2019.

The Group has financial instruments indexed to the EURIBOR, which continues to be quoted daily, and the related cash flows continue to be exchanged with counterparties as usual. In relation to this parameter, there is therefore no uncertainty resulting from the IBOR reform on 31 December 2022. These instruments are subject to daily collateralisation remunerated to EONIA (from 2022 defined as ESTR plus 8.5 bps).

In addition, the Group holds interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that have the variable "leg" indexed to the EURIBOR, with a nominal value of €31,936 million, almost entirely held by BancoPosta RFC. For almost all of these instruments, the cash flows at 31 December 2022 are discounted at the EONIA rate (ESTR + 8.5 bps) and not at the ESTR rate as defined in the contracts in place with the counterparties.
